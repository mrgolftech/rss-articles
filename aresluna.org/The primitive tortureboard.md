The primitive tortureboard
Untangling the myths and mysteries of Dvorak and QWERTY
This essay was originally published in December 2023 as sixth chapter of the book

There weren’t many who hated QWERTY more. To his credit, there was a lot to hate. The layout seemed random, with letters strewn around without rhyme or reason. Watching someone type on it felt painful: fingers flailed wildly all over the place, common letters far away from the home row necessitated more travel, and there were long stretches of one hand doing all the work while the other sat idle. Adding insult to injury, it wasn’t even really that difficult to spot someone using a QWERTY-wearing typewriter. The layout was already so ubiquitous, it was known as “the universal keyboard.”
But he felt it didn’t deserve to be. “It would be difficult to design a key-board over which the hands must travel farther,” he said. There was nothing smart about it; QWERTY “was not arranged on any principle, but resulted from the necessity of humoring the construction of the early machine.” He wanted to build a
principled
keyboard instead.
Eventually, after much deliberation, he did so. He arranged the most common letters in one row, so the hands didn’t have to leave it except for rarer letters, which represented only 30% of characters typed: “The hands travel over the least possible distance. Almost all word endings are close to the spacebar.” Switching to the new keyboard would save 15% of typing time, and the training wouldn’t take long. The keyboard “can be memorized and high speed attained on it in one-quarter the time required for the Universal.”
It was a great keyboard with a great layout. He could’ve called it by his name – George C. Blickensderfer – but he had a better one. If the other keyboard was Universal, his would be Scientific.
The Scientific keyboard was unveiled in 1893 at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, attached to a few brand-new typewriters. Those
were
named after him. Blickensderfer Model 1 was the fully featured model, with some other interesting ideas: an implement for easier line-drawing, automatic word spacing, and extra keys like
The
,
And
, and
Other
that output short words. There was a simpler version, the Model 3, and even the tiny Model 5 had a few interesting features: instead of swinging typebars, it had a type
wheel
that would rotate when a typist pressed keys. The wheel could be swapped out, which meant you could easily type in many different fonts, and in many different languages.
All three typewriters were fascinating, and Blickensderfer already had a track record of being an inventor that knew how to follow through. But he could not afford more than a small booth at an exposition of twenty-two other typewriter manufacturers – and bad luck would put his right next to Remington’s lavish display.
Little did he know in 1893 that the rest of his career would be defined by bad luck, too. The high hopes for Model 1 never materialized – all the interest and preorders went towards the dirt-cheap, minuscule Model 5. Not that it was bad, of course. The typewriter gained an affectionate nickname: “Blick 5,” or “the five-pound secretary.” It was a bit clumsy, but also portable and affordable.
It struck an interesting balance of features and set a price point between cheap, cumbersome index typewriters, and big-featured desktop machines like Remington’s.
“There are few old typewriters with as much charm,” mentioned one collector more recently.

Blickensderfer wasn’t done inventing by then. His later, fascinating Blick Oriental could not only type in two alphabets, but one of them – Hebrew – printed right to left. In 1902, he created one of the first electric typewriters in history, the Blickensderfer Electric. And then, there was also the Niagara – a typewriter that produced coded messages, aimed at the lucrative diplomatic and military markets.
In an alternate universe, all of them matured and became product lines that set the tone of the industry for decades. But not in this one. The Oriental was great, but it had limited market appeal. The Electric appeared too early when people were still unaccustomed to electricity. The Niagara’s cipher, advertised as unbreakable and purportedly built over the course of nine years, was cracked within twenty-four hours by a government code expert.
The Scientific keyboard wasn’t having that much luck, either. The layout, also known as DHIA­TENSOR – named for the bottom row of home keys holding the most popular vowels and consonants right under the typist’s fingertips – proved unpopular with customers already used to QWERTY. Four years after its introduction, Blickensderfer began offering an option to furnish his typewriters with the dreaded, unprincipled universal keyboard. (A rumor started that he even requested such customers to sign a release claiming he wasn’t liable for any bad consequences of using QWERTY.) A few years later, he was forced to go further, offering an option to convert a Scientific keyboard to a Universal for a mere six dollars. This option was presented in the catalog with a wistful and never exercised “or vice versa.”
And even then, Blickensderfer backed the wrong horse, his QWERTY machines equipped with three banks of keys and two rows, a combination already losing the Shift Wars on people’s desks. The adoption of touch typing and the runaway success of the Underwood would soon cement four banks as the only viable option – and just when Blickensderfer introduced that, too, World War I stopped his production and killed all the exports of the prior machines. The final nail in the coffin was a new portable entrant, the Corona 3, that took away most of the domestic market.

George Blickensderfer’s military inventions kept the company going through the Great War, but he himself did not see the end of it. He died in 1917. In the words of one of the historians, his passing “ripped the heart out of the company.” The production of most of the machines ended then. In 1921, Remington, the company whose fair booth dwarfed the introduction of his first three typewriters – and the creator of the Universal keyboard – bought the factory and the patents. After 28 years, the dream of the Scientific Key-Board was gone.

Stop me if you’ve heard any of the following claims before. QWERTY was completely random, put together without any thought. Or, if there was any reasoning behind it, it was just putting all the letters necessary to spell T-Y-P-E-W-R-I-T-E-R in the top row, to make it easy to wow customers. How about this version: QWERTY was built to slow the typist down as the early typewriters could not handle high typing speeds, attained by moving frequent pairs of letters as far away as possible. QWERTY was, basically, the worst layout possible. It was built without any ergonomic considerations. It wasn’t great for touch typing.
I bet you also heard of the keyboard layout that was the opposite of all the above – the mythical Dvorak keyboard. It was just what Blickensderfer once wanted, only even better. It was
the perfect layout
, put together with thought and care. It was efficient
and
comfortable. It was made for touch typing. It allowed the typists to reach 180wpm, fast enough to write down people’s words
as they were speaking
. But it wasn’t undone by bad luck – it was sabotaged by typewriter companies and typewriter teachers. Or, if it wasn’t, it was still better than QWERTY, and the market treated it unfairly. The fact that none of us type on a Dvorak today is one of the keyboard universe’s biggest injustices.
Some of those arguments are true, some not. Funnily enough, many of them are
neither
. Let’s unpeel the QWERTY and Dvorak myths and understand why the story is much more complicated than it appears, and much more interesting than most people give it credit for.
The first challenge: neither Sholes nor any of his inner-circle compatriots wrote a book, a paper, or even left behind notes explaining why QWERTY looks the way it does. This wasn’t an academic project, or a side interest. They were running a business. Sharing wasn’t necessary and could be corporate suicide. Either way, sharing would also distract from the hard, multi-year task of designing a typewriter.
Today, we can only piece the story from a scant few letters, patent applications, and models – plus a lot of informed speculation to fill in the blanks.

Some facts are certain. Early typewriter prototypes, the ones still looking like a piano, started in the most obvious, alphabetical order (or, at rare times, reversed alphabetical). Sholes had problems with some typebars bumping into one another while typing, and he started rearranging the letters to alleviate the issues. Remington made the last few changes after Sholes and Densmore gave them the rights to produce the machine.
There’s also the evidence of a tiny 1878 prototype typewriter used to test different typebar suspension ideas. That typewriter only has two rows of six keys each. The top one goes
S
O
H
L
W
I
, and the bottom one
R
D
T
P
E
Y
. These don’t seem like particularly exciting keys, except if you realize they can write a pertinent phrase: “SHOLES TYPEWRITER.”
But this was a tiny throwaway machine. As for the real typewriter, we’ve discovered enough models, patents, and illustrations to tell us the last four years of QWERTY evolution looked something like these layouts:
Historians don’t know if changes proceeded in that exact order – or whether some of them were transcription mistakes. But there’s enough smoke to know for sure there must have been fire: QWERTY did evolve between 1872 and 1876, and it’s likely its emergence started years before. Even if we don’t quite understand it yet, it no longer feels that the layout was just an act of randomness – we can see a definite
