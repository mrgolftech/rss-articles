<p>It's taken four months, but the next release of <a href="https://logicforprogrammers.com" target="_blank">Logic for Programmers is now available</a>! v0.13 is over 50,000 words, making it both 20% larger than v0.12 and officially the longest thing I have ever written.<sup id="fnref:longest"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:longest">1</a></sup> Full release notes are <a href="https://github.com/logicforprogrammers/book-assets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">here</a>, but I'll talk a bit about the biggest changes. </p>
<p>For one, every chapter has been rewritten. Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id="fnref:gross-additions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:gross-additions">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>
<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general "themes" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/" target="_blank">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/" target="_blank">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/" target="_blank">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this "compatibility" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>
<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>
<p>Just like all the content was in <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/" target="_blank">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/" target="_blank">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/" target="_blank">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>
<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's "just" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>
<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>
<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>

<h2>Conference Season</h2>
<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy! Here's where I'm speaking so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://qconlondon.com/" target="_blank">QCon London</a>, March 16-19</li>
<li><a href="https://craft-conf.com/2026" target="_blank">Craft Conference</a>, Budapest, June 4-5</li>
<li><a href="https://softwareshould.work/" target="_blank">Software Should Work</a>, Missouri, July 16-17</li>
<li><a href="https://hfpug.org/" target="_blank">Houston Functional Programmers</a>, Virtual, December 3</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first three I'm giving variations of my talk "How to find bugs in systems that don't exist", which I gave last year at <a href="https://systemsdistributed.com/" target="_blank">Systems Distributed</a>. Last one will ideally be a talk based on LfP. </p>

<p>The second longest was my 2003 NaNoWriMo. The third longest was <em>Practical TLA+</em>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fnref:longest" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:gross-additions">
<p>This means I must have written 20,000 words total. For comparison, the v0.1 release was 19,000 words.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fnref:gross-additions" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
