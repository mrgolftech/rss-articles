With agentic coding, Xcode can work with greater autonomy toward a developer’s goals\u2009—\u2009from breaking down tasks to making decisions based on the project architecture and using built-in tools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t know if this is super-duper interesting news, but I think it’s super-duper interesting that Apple saw the need to release this now, not at WWDC in June.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/03/xcode-ai-agentic-coding" title="Permanent link to ‘Xcode 26.3 ‘Unlocks the Power of Agentic Coding’’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
