{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/feed', 'value': '<p>This upcoming Sunday is Super Bowl LX, the championship game of the top professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football"> American football</a> league. The Super Bowl thinks that it is so important that it uses Roman numerals.)</p>\n<p>The Super Bowl is the single largest sporting event in the United States. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070202-17/?p=28173" title="Super Bowl Sunday: The day the entire country stops doing anything"> The entire country grinds to a halt when the game is on</a>. If you aren&#8217;t interested in the game, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150130-01/?p=44783" title="Got errands? Now is the time"> it&#8217;s a great time to do public photography or run errands</a>.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the mayors of the home cities of the two teams competing in the game make a friendly wager, with each mayor offering to send the other mayor some local products if their team loses. For example, in 2014, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/1/27/5351434/super-bowl-2014-seattle-denver-mayor-bet-seahawks-broncos-macklemore" title="Super Bowl 2014: Seattle, Denver mayors agree to bet"> the mayors of Seattle and Denver wagered local foods and products as well as having to wear clothing inspired by the other team&#8217;s city</a>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes other city organizations get into the friendly wagering spirit. In 2018, <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/story/its-philadelphia-orchestra-and-boston-symphony-have-super-bowl-bet/" title="It\'s On: The Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Have a Super Bowl Bet"> the Philadelphia Orchestra and Boston Symphony agreed that the losing city&#8217;s conductor would have to wear the winning city&#8217;s jersey at their next rehearsal</a>.</p>\n<p>But certainly we can do better than that.</p>\n<p>The two teams competing in Super Bowl LX are the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots (based near Boston). I think the Seattle Symphony and the Boston Symphony should engage in their own friendly wager: If the Seahawks win, then the Boston Symphony must play Erich Korngold&#8217;s &#8220;The Sea Hawk&#8221; at an upcoming concert. If the Patriots win, then the Seattle Symphony must play John Williams&#8217;s &#8220;The Patriot&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260204-01/?p=112039">Super Bowl LX creates an opportunity for symphonic friendly wagering</a> appeared first on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}
