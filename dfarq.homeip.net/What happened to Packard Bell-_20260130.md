What happened to Packard Bell computers? The firm ceased operations in the United States in 2000. Its former rival, Acer, acquired the brand January 31, 2008 for $46 million. It was a once-unimaginable outcome for what had been the top-selling computer brand in the United States.
But there’s more to the story than that. The Packard Bell story is a brilliant piece of marketing. The computers were terrible, but the marketing was as good as it gets. And that’s one of the reasons people remember it as one of the more prominent of the
90s computer brands
, even if many who remember it don’t remember it fondly.
Packard Bell thrived on brand confusion
This promotional coffee mug features the slogan “America grew up listening to us. It still does.” The slogan encouraged people to think of an upstart as an old company. It dates to the late 1980s or early 1990s. What happened to Packard Bell? Bad quality caught up with it.
In 1986, Packard Bell was the name of a defunct manufacturer of TVs and radios. Founded in 1926 or 1933 depending on how you count it, it survived until 1968 when it sold out to Teledyne.
In the 1980s the brand still had some name recognition on its own. But look at the other names it resembled: Pacific Bell, the telephone company.
Hewlett Packard
, the computer company. Packard, the defunct maker of luxury cars.
It sounded like an old-line company making quality products, which was what Beny Alagem counted on. He even put the slogan “America grew up listening to us. It still does,” on its early marketing literature.
People always confused them for something they weren’t, and for a time, it helped. “I don’t know about other brands,” one customer said to me when I was selling computers in 1994, pointing at Compaq and Dell. “But Packard Bell, that’s an old company.” Even my coworkers routinely thought Packard Bell was related to HP or to Packard, the car maker.
Brand resurrections
don’t always work
. But this one was one of the more successful ones in history, better than
Atari
but not quite as good as
DeWalt
. I think this one worked because there were multiple factors involved.
Packard Bell’s industrial design
This Packard Bell D160 dates to the mid 1990s. The gray panel accents, created by Frog Design, were innovative for the time. Also note the updated logo.
For about the first seven years, Packard Bell computers were generic-looking clones, but in 1994 they started changing things up. They had been one of the first companies to try to make desktop PCs smaller. And in 1994 when everyone was selling beige boxes, they brought in a firm called Frog Design to revamp their cases with different colors and even changing form factors including an
unorthodox L-shaped corner design
.
Was it great design? Ask an industrial designer. But I have to give them credit for trying. At the very least, their computers had a distinctive look. I will say my graphic design professor in college, Dr. Birgit Wassmuth, who was a
huge
admirer of Apple and SGI, called out Packard Bell by name for trying to make computers that weren’t boring beige boxes. At the time, their designs were more bold than anything even Apple dared. From her perspective, here was a firm giving SGI-like designs at a rock-bottom price.
But it takes more than industrial design to make great computers. What happened to Packard Bell? One of my classmates answered Dr. Wassmuth: “Packard BELL? They make the lowest quality computers you can buy!”
Dr. Wassmuth diplomatically said she could only comment on the industrial design. She was a professor of design, not electrical engineering.
It would have been a brilliant move, but instead, it was more like a last hurrah before their quality issues started catching up with them.
Quality, or lack thereof
Early on, Packard Bell PCs were OK. Their XT- and 286-class PCs lacked pizzazz, but by and large gave average reliability for a low price. That was largely because they were rebadged machines made by other OEMs, such as Samsung. By the 386SX era though, they were cheap and unreliable. And they stayed that way.
The price meant they sold well. Very well, well enough to overtake
Tandy
as the best-selling brand of computer in North America. Typically they
cost a couple hundred dollars less
than a comparable PC from Hewlett Packard,
Compaq
(then a separate company),
Dell
, or
IBM
. When I worked at
Best Buy
in the mid 1990s, Packard Bell may have accounted for 50% of our computer sales, on its own.
The problem was that if there was a corner to cut, they cut it. With exactly one exception. Since they put Intel CPUs in their PCs, they benefited from Intel’s “Intel Inside” marketing campaign. Even some CIOs thought a Packard Bell computer with an Intel CPU in it was better than anything with an
AMD
or
Cyrix
chip in it. It wasn’t true, but it proves how well those marketing campaigns worked together. Our local Compaq sales rep hated Intel for it, and that was why Compaq gave startup cash to Intel competitors like
Nexgen
. Compaq made better machines and didn’t appreciate Intel telling everyone otherwise.
Everything else inside a Packard Bell computer was lowest-bidder. Making matters worse, the power supplies tended to be weird form factors so you couldn’t replace them with a $40 off-the-shelf unit when they failed, which was often. A replacement OEM unit cost $200 and would fail just as quickly as the old one did. Some of their motherboards were NLX form factor, which was expensive but replaceable. Others were weird form factors with no off the shelf replacement. Part of this was due to Packard Bell’s unique industrial design. The computers looked good, but it limited what parts you could use to fix them.
Poor quality doesn’t have to be a death sentence.
Gateway 2000
sold PCs that were below average in quality. People bought them anyway because Gateway had great customer service. Packard Bell combined below-average quality with lousy customer service. I personally took a lot of phone calls from Packard Bell buyers. It was easier to call the store for answers than the manufacturer. We got more repeat customers than Packard Bell did.
Packard Bell’s many sad returns
I avoided Packard Bell when I sold computers because I wanted to sell solutions that would last. I saw how many of their computers came back. Officially, it was 1 in 6 sold. Industry average at the time was 1 in 12.
Sometimes they came back with a good story. Early in the 386 era, computers came with keys. You could lock them to keep someone from turning them on without permission.
Well, someone bought one, brought it home, set it up, and couldn’t make it work. So they brought it back. “I followed the instructions perfectly,” he said. “Then I turned the key and nothing happened!”
It’s a computer, not a lawnmower. The key story remained a running joke for years.
But more often than not, there was no humorous story involved. Just an unhappy customer who got buyer’s remorse in less than four weeks. The hope was that customer service could talk them into an exchange rather than a refund.
Stores’ policies toward Packard Bell
I worked at Best Buy for a couple of years. Our main competitor, Circuit City, also carried them. The two stores’ attitudes toward Packard Bell was very different. Circuit City would advertise Packard Bell computers in the Sunday papers, but if you came into the store, they trashed talked Packard Bell, in hopes of getting you to buy an
AST
instead. And truthfully? They didn’t have to lie. They could honestly say you were twice as likely to have a major problem with a Packard Bell computer than any other brand.
Best Buy’s policy was to position Packard Bell in a good-better-best lineup. Packard Bell was (allegedly) good. Acer was better. Compaq, Dell (or HP), and IBM were best.
I pushed other brands because I wanted to sleep at night. If a customer came in with their mind set on Packard Bell, I’d load one up on a cart for them. But if they wanted to talk about it, I directed them toward better brands. I never said anything bad about Packard Bell, but I gave nonverbal cues. I sold a lot of computers, but very few Packard Bells. Some of my coworkers flat out lied about Packard Bell quality. I’m not sure if they knew they were lying or were just repeating what they’d heard someone else say. But I wanted to sleep at night so I wouldn’t do that.
The favored line, when a customer said they heard Packard Bell computers were bad, was to say they may have had problems in the past, but they’d come a long way, and then offer an extended warranty. Sorry, a “performance guarantee.”
What happened to Packard Bell was that eventually, the lies didn’t work anymore. Once Compaq released its
Presario line
which narrowed the price difference, there was little reason to buy the lower quality machine.
Few repeat buyers
Not many people bought a second Packard Bell. They’d get a $1,500 bundle–which was cheap for the time–and when the computer broke, they’d buy a different brand and reuse the monitor and printer and whatever was left in the machine that still worked. Frequently the memory, CD-ROM drive, and sound card could be salvaged and re-used in a new PC.
Packard Bell consistently received bad ratings from the
PC magazines like
PC World
and
PC Magazine
and from consumer magazines like
Consumer Reports
. But the final blow was the 1995 revelation in that Packard Bell routinely sold “new” PCs with recycled parts in them. That year, Packard Bell merged with NEC, the Japanese electronics maker. Some hoped that would mean better quality and lower prices due to the increased volume. The synergy didn’t happen. By 2000, NEC pulled the name off the market.
Packard Bell survived longer in Europe, though in name only as a division of Acer. Acer acquired Packard Bell on January 31, 2008 for a mere $46 million. Speculation at the time was that Acer bought Packard Bell to keep Lenovo from getting the brand nam
