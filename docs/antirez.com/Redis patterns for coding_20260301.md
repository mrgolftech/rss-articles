Here LLM and coding agents can find:
<br />
<br />1. Exhaustive documentation about Redis commands and data types.
<br />2. Patterns commonly used.
<br />3. Configuration hints.
<br />4. Algorithms that can be mounted using Redis commands.

<br />Some humans claim this documentation is actually useful for actual people, as well :) I'm posting this to make sure search engines will index it.
