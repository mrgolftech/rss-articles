Fav tech museums
I love technology history because it brings me both advice and encouragement: stories of people solving problems despite constraints much bigger than mine, stories of flawed inventions and flawed inventors, stories of oddities that can inform and inspire.
Sometimes the blueprints for the best version of the future already exist in the past, but only if you do some spelunking first, and remixing second. Those who read history
will
be able to repeat it, but under better circumstances, or more stellar execution.
Technology history means visiting tech museums, and I have been doing that for decades now. I wanted to reflect on why I love some of them more than the others, so I made this photo essay: six best tech museums I’ve been to, 16 great ones… and, at the end, three not-as-positive examples.
I wrote it mostly for myself to think about what museums mean for me and what makes for the best museum experiences, but perhaps you will find something in it, too.
I liked
more museums
than presented here, of course. And I have a lot more to visit (please
let me know
if you have suggestions!). But of the ones I have been to, these are the ones that deserve a spotlight.
The best tech museums that I’ve been to
National Railway Museum Park / Taipei Railway Workshop
Taiwan (the site near Songshan Park) / Visited in 2025 /
nrm.gov.tw
This place blew me away. It’s a newish museum, but hosted in an old, massive railway workshop building complex, so you know the space itself is going to be part of the story – locomotives, huge industrial cranes that lift them around, various bits and pieces of preserved machinery. I generally love this kind of a vibe (even the
smell
of it all) and find it, in a way, breathtaking. Part of me would choose to live here in an instant.
But, there are more things that make this museum special.
A snippet of one of the videos
The production value is impeccable and it seems to be spent on things that matter. For example, there are absolutely magnificent videos here of men restoring old locomotives, presented on big vertical displays. They’re transfixing, almost pornographic. But they still feel made by someone who cares about this stuff and wants to show it well, and not just show it
off
.
The landmark exhibit here is a multimedia piece with a huge transparent screen occasionally moving by an important locomotive, showing its innards. It’s a lavish, impressive animation, with huge thumping bass and 3D renders… maybe a bit too cinematic, but again: it feels like it’s coming from the right place. Trains are amazing and underrated, and they deserve awe.
Generally, there’s a lot of pride around here, and it feels like the right flavor of pride. In many exhibits, one can sense how people care about restoring the old machines and telling their stories, how the railways mattered to Taiwan, how important this preservation of history as a concept is to people here.
Flanking the big building with amazing sightlines are some smaller, more traditional exhibits. The focus seems to be a bit more on the cultural aspects of railways, and less on the tech side. I learned so much from it all.
Overall, it’s a fantastic blend of old and new, with thoughtful details.
It’s big and inspiring enough I came back again a week later. There are many other disused buildings around the refurbished one that haven’t been touched yet, and I understand the aspiration is to turn it into almost a park of sorts. I hope I’ll be back to check out how they’re doing.
In a few rooms that have vintage phones as part of showing old offices or ticket booths, those phones occasionally ring. I found that so delightful.
Museu de la Tècnica de l’Empordà
Figueres, Spain / Visited in 2016 and 2022 /
mte.cat
This was perhaps my best museum
experience
ever – the right thing at the right time in an unexpected place and with unexpected intensity.
This thread
captured the story, and I
reflected upon it later here
.
So yeah, I’m biased, but the reasons for that bias are worth celebrating. This museum definitely belongs to the joint category of “great collection” + “great passion,” with so many typewriters you could sometimes even pause and trace the history of individual manufacturer, as all of their models are shown side by side like on a timeline.
There’s also something I always appreciate: the ephemera. It’s not just typewriters, but also the desks, the accessories, the advertisements, the complementary devices. 			There is a risk of a museum doing that kind of stuff in a way that feels like hoarding and I don’t fully understand yet what separates one from the other.
This museum is not an extreme time capsule like other museums can be, but I find the ephemera crucial to understanding the machines. Nothing, after all, is used in isolation, and no device can be removed from the context of its time and its surroundings.
I quip sometimes that the only difference between collecting and hoarding are the stories.
I’m also very happy I got to briefly meet the creator of the museum (and his whole family) before his passing.
ACMI
Melbourne / Visited in 2024 /
acmi.net.au
My photos won’t do ACMI justice. This is an extremely well-made museum, filled with great experiences and stories. Every exhibit here drips with creativity, from simple ideas like splitting a car in half with two well-placed mirrors, or miniatures of TV rooms held inside actual TVs. There are probably fifty great little details here that will make you happy even if you don’t notice them, and are a proof that a museum is so much more than its collection.
Even the applications of technology are wonderful and exemplary. This isn’t a museum where you’d encounter a piece of paper saying “under maintenance” slapped atop a stock Android tablet. For example, there is one exhibit here where you can edit a video by moving wooden blocks:
Upon entry, you get a cool artifact resembling a
View-Master reel
where you “collect” interesting information by tapping on things; most museums would screw this up somehow, and here it works flawlessly and the interactions are delightful. It feels the way we want tech to be –  serving and enhancing, integrated, reliable, in the background.
ACMI’s
Lens
in use: “collecting” artifacts, and at a meta exhibit where you can see connections between things you collected
You can tell the museum is run by a designer! This is all really creative and endlessly inspiring. Top of my list. My strict travel plans meant I only visited once, and I regret it, as I feel I only scratched the surface.
Computer­spiele­museum / Computer Game Museum
Berlin / Visited in 2018 /
computerspielemuseum.de
This museum punches above its weight. Most videogame museums I’ve seen are vehicles for hollow nostalgia, arcades by a different name. But Berlin’s Computer Game Museum has more depth and tries to do the art and history of videogames justice.
There
is
a little arcade here, for sure, even styled appropriately and with a cute list of highscores. There are also a few nicely recreated “teenager” rooms matching different decades.
But there are also rare prototypes of local games (like the East Germany’s
Poly-Play
), and some art pieces like
PainStation
,
ROM CHECK FAIL
, and the world’s worst Pac-Man made even worse by attaching it to a comically oversized Atari joystick (shoes off!). The selection of games continues to be surprising elsewhere: Would you expect to see Stanley Parable here? Or ELIZA?
The design of the place is also interesting. There’s always something around the corner that catches your attention, sometimes with the rooms and machines complimenting each other visually.
This museum made me think. Really nicely done.
I wrote a
thread on social
if you are curious to learn a bit more.
Bonami Spel­Computer Museum
Zwolle, The Netherlands / Visited in 2022 /
computermuseum.nl
In the 2000s, the
Computer History Museum
’s then-new location had an interim state called The Visible Storage: raw shelves, filled with computers. There were some plaques, but most stories came from volunteer docents (I eventually became one of them) running the show.
The Dutch Bonami museum is that, except there are no docents. Oh, and the whole place is
massive
.
I have never seen this many microcomputers under one roof. Not even close. I think there must be thousands of computers here, and it’s funny how just the scale alone elevates the museum.
Without that scale, there would be so much room for improvement. Turn on more of these computers so you can play with them (currently, only a scant few are allowed this). Tell better stories. Add production value.
But turns out, sometimes scale is enough. Enter Bonami and you feel awash in microcomputers, surrounded by what feels like the entirety of the 1980s and the 1990s. You can compare small differences between models, ponder design details, find obscure machines you didn’t know existed. It’s worth checking it out to see how this
amount
of computers makes you feel.
Home­Computer­Museum
Helmond, The Netherlands / Visited in 2022 /
homecomputermuseum.nl
Perhaps an apotheosis of a certain kind of a computer museum: all microcomputers, some turned on, catering to nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s.
There’s nothing bad about this approach, but many places do that and after a while it all feels kind of same’y. Not here. Many of the machines here are in working condition and ready to play, which is already very nice. And there will be a few surprises: restoring a Dutch graphics computer Aesthedes with an impressive
island of a keyboard
, a few Dutch machines like the distinctively shaped
Holborn
and Eindhoven’s CHE-1, or a “time machine” 1990 Tulip computer that allows you to browse the internet like it appeared decades ago.
The design and decor are slightly better than elsewhere, too, with various thematic displays, and an open, welcoming feel – and generally it feels the museum is
cared for
in a way many are not.
