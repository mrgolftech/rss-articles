#  Fav tech museums 

I love technology history because it brings me both advice and encouragement: stories of people solving problems despite constraints much bigger than mine, stories of flawed inventions and flawed inventors, stories of oddities that can inform and inspire. 

Sometimes the blueprints for the best version of the future already exist in the past, but only if you do some spelunking first, and remixing second. Those who read history _will_ be able to repeat it, but under better circumstances, or more stellar execution. 

Technology history means visiting tech museums, and I have been doing that for decades now. I wanted to reflect on why I love some of them more than the others, so I made this photo essay: six best tech museums Iâve been to, 16 great onesâ¦ and, at the end, three not-as-positive examples. 

I wrote it mostly for myself to think about what museums mean for me and what makes for the best museum experiences, but perhaps you will find something in it, too. 

I liked [ more museums](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mwichary/albums/) than presented here, of course. And I have a lot more to visit (please [let me know](https://aresluna.org) if you have suggestions!). But of the ones I have been to, these are the ones that deserve a spotlight. 

##  The best tech museums that Iâve been to 

###  National Railway Museum Park / Taipei Railway Workshop 

Taiwan (the site near Songshan Park)Â /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [nrm.gov.tw](https://www.nrm.gov.tw/en/)

This place blew me away. Itâs a newish museum, but hosted in an old, massive railway workshop building complex, so you know the space itself is going to be part of the story â locomotives, huge industrial cranes that lift them around, various bits and pieces of preserved machinery. I generally love this kind of a vibe (even the _smell_ of it all) and find it, in a way, breathtaking. Part of me would choose to live here in an instant. 

But, there are more things that make this museum special. 

A snippet of one of the videos

The production value is impeccable and it seems to be spent on things that matter. For example, there are absolutely magnificent videos here of men restoring old locomotives, presented on big vertical displays. Theyâre transfixing, almost pornographic. But they still feel made by someone who cares about this stuff and wants to show it well, and not just show it _off_. 

The landmark exhibit here is a multimedia piece with a huge transparent screen occasionally moving by an important locomotive, showing its innards. Itâs a lavish, impressive animation, with huge thumping bass and 3D rendersâ¦ maybe a bit too cinematic, but again: it feels like itâs coming from the right place. Trains are amazing and underrated, and they deserve awe. 

Generally, thereâs a lot of pride around here, and it feels like the right flavor of pride. In many exhibits, one can sense how people care about restoring the old machines and telling their stories, how the railways mattered to Taiwan, how important this preservation of history as a concept is to people here. 

Flanking the big building with amazing sightlines are some smaller, more traditional exhibits. The focus seems to be a bit more on the cultural aspects of railways, and less on the tech side. I learned so much from it all. 

Overall, itâs a fantastic blend of old and new, with thoughtful details. Itâs big and inspiring enough I came back again a week later. There are many other disused buildings around the refurbished one that havenât been touched yet, and I understand the aspiration is to turn it into almost a park of sorts. I hope Iâll be back to check out how theyâre doing. 

In a few rooms that have vintage phones as part of showing old offices or ticket booths, those phones occasionally ring. I found that so delightful.

###  Museu de la TÃ¨cnica de lâEmpordÃ 

Figueres, SpainÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â [mte.cat](http://mte.cat/)

This was perhaps my best museum _experience_ ever â the right thing at the right time in an unexpected place and with unexpected intensity. [This thread](https://aresluna.org/something-magical-happened-to-me-today/) captured the story, and I [reflected upon it later here](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/something-magical-happened-to-me-today/). 

So yeah, Iâm biased, but the reasons for that bias are worth celebrating. This museum definitely belongs to the joint category of âgreat collectionâ + âgreat passion,â with so many typewriters you could sometimes even pause and trace the history of individual manufacturer, as all of their models are shown side by side like on a timeline. 

Thereâs also something I always appreciate: the ephemera. Itâs not just typewriters, but also the desks, the accessories, the advertisements, the complementary devices. There is a risk of a museum doing that kind of stuff in a way that feels like hoarding and I donât fully understand yet what separates one from the other. This museum is not an extreme time capsule like other museums can be, but I find the ephemera crucial to understanding the machines. Nothing, after all, is used in isolation, and no device can be removed from the context of its time and its surroundings. 

I quip sometimes that the only difference between collecting and hoarding are the stories.

Iâm also very happy I got to briefly meet the creator of the museum (and his whole family) before his passing.

###  ACMI 

MelbourneÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â [acmi.net.au](https://www.acmi.net.au/)

My photos wonât do ACMI justice. This is an extremely well-made museum, filled with great experiences and stories. Every exhibit here drips with creativity, from simple ideas like splitting a car in half with two well-placed mirrors, or miniatures of TV rooms held inside actual TVs. There are probably fifty great little details here that will make you happy even if you donât notice them, and are a proof that a museum is so much more than its collection. 

Even the applications of technology are wonderful and exemplary. This isnât a museum where youâd encounter a piece of paper saying âunder maintenanceâ slapped atop a stock Android tablet. For example, there is one exhibit here where you can edit a video by moving wooden blocks: 

Upon entry, you get a cool artifact resembling a [View-Master reel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master) where you âcollectâ interesting information by tapping on things; most museums would screw this up somehow, and here it works flawlessly and the interactions are delightful. It feels the way we want tech to be â serving and enhancing, integrated, reliable, in the background. 

ACMIâs [Lens](https://www.acmi.net.au/lens/) in use: âcollectingâ artifacts, and at a meta exhibit where you can see connections between things you collected

You can tell the museum is run by a designer! This is all really creative and endlessly inspiring. Top of my list. My strict travel plans meant I only visited once, and I regret it, asÂ I feel I only scratched the surface.

###  Computer­spiele­museum / Computer Game Museum 

BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â [computerspielemuseum.de](https://computerspielemuseum.de)

This museum punches above its weight. Most videogame museums Iâve seen are vehicles for hollow nostalgia, arcades by a different name. But Berlinâs Computer Game Museum has more depth and tries to do the art and history of videogames justice. 

There _is_ a little arcade here, for sure, even styled appropriately and with a cute list of highscores. There are also a few nicely recreated âteenagerâ rooms matching different decades. 

But there are also rare prototypes of local games (like the East Germanyâs [Poly-Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly-Play)), and some art pieces like [PainStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PainStation), [ROM CHECK FAIL](https://www.farbs.org/romcheckfail.php), and the worldâs worst Pac-Man made even worse by attaching it to a comically oversized Atari joystick (shoes off!). The selection of games continues to be surprising elsewhere: Would you expect to see Stanley Parable here? Or ELIZA? 

The design of the place is also interesting. Thereâs always something around the corner that catches your attention, sometimes with the rooms and machines complimenting each other visually. 

This museum made me think. Really nicely done.

I wrote a [thread on social](https://aresluna.org/berlin-videogame-museum/) if you are curious to learn a bit more.

###  Bonami Spel­Computer Museum 

Zwolle, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â [computermuseum.nl](https://computermuseum.nl/)

In the 2000s, the [Computer History Museum](fav-tech-museums/#computer-history-museum)âs then-new location had an interim state called The Visible Storage: raw shelves, filled with computers. There were some plaques, but most stories came from volunteer docents (I eventually became one of them) running the show. 

![](images/fav-tech-museums/chm-visible-storage/img5943.avif) ![](images/fav-tech-museums/chm-visible-storage/img5977.avif)

The Dutch Bonami museum is that, except there are no docents. Oh, and the whole place is _massive_. 

I have never seen this many microcomputers under one roof. Not even close. I think there must be thousands of computers here, and itâs funny how just the scale alone elevates the museum. 

Without that scale, there would be so much room for improvement. Turn on more of these computers so you can play with them (currently, only a scant few are allowed this). Tell better stories. Add production value. 

But turns out, sometimes scale is enough. Enter Bonami and you feel awash in microcomputers, surrounded by what feels like the entirety of the 1980s and the 1990s. You can compare small differences between models, ponder design details, find obscure machines you didnât know existed. Itâs worth checking it out to see how this _amount_ of computers makes you feel.

###  Home­Computer­Museum 

Helmond, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â [homecomputermuseum.nl](https://www.homecomputermuseum.nl/en/)

Perhaps an apotheosis of a certain kind of a computer museum: all microcomputers, some turned on, catering to nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s. 

Thereâs nothing bad about this approach, but many places do that and after a while it all feels kind of sameây. Not here. Many of the machines here are in working condition and ready to play, which is already very nice. And there will be a few surprises: restoring a Dutch graphics computer Aesthedes with an impressive [island of a keyboard](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-modifiers-vs-the-keepers/), a few Dutch machines like the distinctively shaped [Holborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn_9100) and Eindhovenâs CHE-1, or a âtime machineâ 1990 Tulip computer that allows you to browse the internet like it appeared decades ago. 

The design and decor are slightly better than elsewhere, too, with various thematic displays, and an open, welcoming feel â and generally it feels the museum is _cared for_ in a way many are not.

The tragically-and-inexplicably-shuttered [Seattle museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs) felt similar.

##  Honorable mentions 

###  Computer History Museum 

Mountain View, CaliforniaÂ /Â Visited in 2009â2023 /Â [computerhistory.org](http://computerhistory.org/)

I love this museum. [I wrote about this at least once](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/to-save-a-keyboard-pt-3/). I made friends here, learned about storytelling here, hung out with a lot of great volunteers, practiced old-computer photography, and deepened my care and understanding of tech history. 

The building is great, the demo rooms with PDP-1 and IBM 1401 are fantastic (you can play one of the first videogames against the very person who made it!), and events can be extraordinary too: be it Vintage Computer Festival West, or occasional talks. 

I miss it now that I live further away. 

The reason this museum didnât make the main list is that the main exhibit is only kind ofâ¦ okay. There is nothing bad about it, but there is nothing great, eitherÂ âÂ no singular thing stands out. The design is just fine, the videos on exhibit screens are a bit garish ([one example here](https://youtu.be/ZPpV8X91neQ?si=FNzet9D4Al5w9rJ1)), and no particular memorable design decision or anything really stands out to me. 

The ending of the main exhibit timeline also kind of peters out, with the web feeling like its weakest part. The museum excels in storytelling through hardware, but things take a dive when things move to software. (To be fair, I am not sure I found a great museum that showcases software well!)

###  Connections Museum  
&  
Houweling Telecom­museum 

SeattleÂ /Â Visited in 2010, 2016, 2019 /Â [telcomhistory.org](https://www.telcomhistory.org/ConnectionsSeattle.html)  
RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [houwelingtelecommuseum.nl](https://www.houwelingtelecommuseum.nl/en/the-museum/)  


Grouping two independent museums in Seattle and Rotterdam because they feel strangely similar, hosted in old telephone exchange buildings, with their infrastructure decommissioned but preserved, restored, and used locally for demonstrations. 

Itâs a fantastic vibe, walking around among tall stacks of technology that occasionally wake up clacking right next to you. Thereâs a certain scale (huge) and feel (electromechanical) of old machinery that cannot be captured by online photos â but you can experience it in person here. 

A wonderful (sound on!) explanatory artifact at the Houweling Telecommuseum

Each of the two museums also hosts a more traditional exhibit in an adjacent room: a general story of telephony and related technologies. In both cases, there is more than you would expect.

###  U-Bahn-Museum Berlin 

BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â [Site](https://www.museumsportal-berlin.de/en/museums/berliner-u-bahn-museum/)

My experience with this museum was colored by the fact that itâs only open once a month. When I visited Berlin, I only thought about searching for a transport museum with two days to spareâ¦ and it just happened to be open on one of these days. Talk about some lucky timing! 

This museum is basically a time machine, an old subway station building preserved and in many ways left intact. There is little information around; I bet this functions more as a place for docents to shine. 

But still, so much great texture! A beautiful building, old machinery, porcelain placards with exquisite German typography, the clocks, the lights, the colorsâ¦ That alone elevated it to something wonderful. I could soak in this forever.

###  London Transport Museum (Acton Town Depot) 

LondonÂ /Â Visited in 2023 /Â [ltmuseum.co.uk](https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/visit/museum-depot)

I always thought the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden has an absolutely world-class [museum store](https://www.ltmuseumshop.co.uk/), but the museum itself is much too small. 

Turns out there they have an answer to that: a huge depot further out from the city center that you can visit on a tour by appointment, filled with vehicles and artifacts. Itâs great, similar in nature to the Computer History Museumâs Visible Storage or [Bonami](/fav-tech-museums#bonami-spelcomputer-museum) I just mentioned above; this is where the strength of the collection is most of the allure. 

The only downside here is that you can only move around semi-freely, as everything is a tour (although there are, apparently, also open days), but otherwise this is a great museum chronicling the stories behind possibly the worldâs most fascinating transit system, satisfying both the hardware and the design sides of my brain.

###  Bob Paquetteâs Microphone Museum 

MilwaukeeÂ /Â Visited in 2017 

This was an amateurish museum, but the word âamateurâ can bite in either direction, and here it felt positive: an old manâs personal collection of microphones, intimately tied to his career, just a few notches away from hoarding, open only by appointment. 

I loved it. I got a tour by Mr. Paquette himself, and a few demos, one including putting something of unknown provenance right in my mouth. 

I donât know if this collection passes some sort of theoretical or academic scrutiny, but the passion alone was palpable and enough. 

Mr. Paquette died since (you can [read this interview](https://tapeop.com/interviews/61/bob-paquette) to get to know him more), and the museum was subsequently dismantled. So it goes. I am happy that I drove by it that one day in 2017.

###  Radio Museum 

RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [rotterdamsradiomuseum.nl](https://www.rotterdamsradiomuseum.nl/)

A similar thing to [Paquetteâs Microphone Museum](/fav-tech-museums/#bob-paquettes-microphone-museum), hiding on a third floor of a seemingly unrelated Dutch company. The name is misleading â this is more of a monument to the entire hi-fi era, with radios flanked by record players, tape players, CD players, hi-fi systems, and so on. 

If youâre into this kind of stuff (I am!), this is delightful; a very nice collection of equipment with all its quirks and strange UI conventions, and some old volunteers willing to explain â if you speak Dutch, that is.

###  KPH 

North of San FranciscoÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â [Site](https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/kph_treetunnel.htm)

In a list that already stretches the definition of museum, this bends it past a breaking point. 

KPH is an old maritime radio station, frozen in time for decades, and now occasionally resurrected not for tours or demonstrations, but for volunteers toâ¦ use it once again to communicate with the ships hanging out nearby. 

I remain enchanted with this building a drive away from San Francisco, where time now stands still. It captures an industry obscure to most, with teletype machines and Morse code mills, which adds a level of authenticity. There is a layer of translation that might be missing to some, but that makes it ever so sweeter if you [manage to translate it yourself](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/a-time-machine-behind-the-cypress-trees/).

###  Narodowe Muzeum Techniki 

ParisÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â [arts-et-metiers.net](https://www.arts-et-metiers.net/musee/visitor-information)  
WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [nmt.waw.pl](https://nmt.waw.pl/en/)  


I used to look down on old tech museums in buildings from a different era. I thought them old and creaky, in desperate need of a whole week of coordinated dusting, themselves needing to be packaged in some sort of a metamuseum â âlook how tech museums used to be made.â 

Perhaps growing older softened that stance, or maybe it was visiting of many museums that felt more modern, yet completely soulless. 

Both of these are old, but worth a visit. They feel like institutions subscribing to an early definition of a âmuseumâ âÂ a historical building, a bit of a distance and aloofness, maybe even some holier-than-thou attitude. But that can also be in a way inspiring, and doesnât mean you canât have fun or learn new things. 

I mentioned âprideâ earlier. Here the right word might perhaps be ârespectâ or âreverence.â A museum can overdo it, of course, but I think these two get the balance right. And, if not, you can just come for the buildings.

###  mNACTEC (Museu Nacional de la CiÃ¨ncia i de la TÃ¨cnica de Catalunya) 

North of BarcelonaÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â [mnactec.cat](https://mnactec.cat/en)

A cool museum north of Barcelona that hosts a sliver of computing history you donât see often: European mainframes. 

Iâm worried that this might mean this part of the museum is not as popular as others â I imagine nostalgia for mainframes is a small sliver of nostalgia for microcomputers â but I appreciate it. There are a lot of microcomputer museums, but not enough of this. 

Mainframes require a lot of room and this museum has that, being in an old building that used to be a cotton mill that itself is part of the attraction. (Also, there is a lot more in the collection, specifically textile mills and cars.)

###  Muzeum InÅ¼ynierii i Techniki / Museum of Engi­neering and Technology 

CracowÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [mit.krakow.pl](https://www.mit.krakow.pl/en/)

I keep harping about âbig buildingsâ and âhuge collectionsâ as something becomes clear in my head: the museums often have an advantage of size. Itâs not that you cannot have a tiny museum that works and means something to peopleâ¦ but if you have a huge building or an impressive collection and you use it well âÂ you have something that few can replicate.

Just donât waste a huge building, like the railway museum in Utrecht does! 

This city tech museum in KrakÃ³w reminded me of that rule in a very simple way: It has human-size photos that are really impressive. Thatâs it. That alone felt worth a price of admission, seeing Poland as it used to be a century ago, like you canât in any other setting. I might have never moved less at a museum, just standing next to each photo for many minutes on end, noticing all the little details. 

(It reminded me of Rick and Megan Prelingerâs [Lost Landscapes of San Francisco](https://longnow.org/talks/02024-prelinger/), which approaches this in a very different format by putting people in a movie theatre once a year and have them watch â and react! â to old clips of San Francisco.) 

Many other design details here made me happy, from typography wrapping around, to dramatic lighting. (Unfortunately, some exhibits here are much more traditional and maybe a bit, to me, boring.)

###  Muzeum NeonÃ³w / Neon Museum 

WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [neonmuzeum.org](https://www.neonmuzeum.org/)

This museum looks good on insta, but it also looks really good in real life. Sometimes itâs as simple as that. For someone who cares about design and a typography, this was really fun and inspiring. 

But this is not just some sort of a tourist trap or a âmuseum of ice creamâ pop-up experience for social. Iâve already watched [a movie about their preservation efforts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQbhdehTe5w), and have one of [their books](https://www.neonmuzeum.org/museum-publications) as well. I wanted to visit it because I like patronizing places where I feel people care, and in hindsight, I have been underestimating the effort and care here. 

By the way, this is in the same fascinating building in Warsaw as [Narodowe Muzeum Techniki](/fav-tech-museums/#narodowe-muzeum-techniki).

###  Muzeum Gazowni Warszawskiej / Museum Gas­works Warsaw 

WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â [muzeum.pgnig.pl](https://muzeum.pgnig.pl/en)

This museum is hiding in an old gasworks factory, with some impressive decommissioned machinery. 

An interesting choice here is that the old building â a once-grimy hall with scary pumps and boilers â is connected with a brand new exhibit, painted in immaculate white, and really nicely put together. 

Unfortunately (and ironically), the museum feels too small, and some of the interactive parts in the ânewâ section fall a bit flat (although I liked how the ticket serves dual duty as a fake employment card you can punch and use elsewhere, and serves as a nice memento). The small size might be disappointing if you trek out here for a visit, and I hope the museum will expand in the future â but then again, I visited it and enjoyed it.

###  Muzeum Techniki i Komunikacji / The Museum of Technology and Transport 

Szczecin, PolandÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â [muzeumtechniki.eu](https://muzeumtechniki.eu/en/)

There are many museums like this â another âvisible storageâ with a bunch of vintage cars and trams under a roof, and not more else (at least not in 2018 when I visited it last), but Iâm putting this on the list for two reasons. 

First, itâs in my home town! 

Second, all the vehicles are in an absolutely immaculate condition. This felt important to me when putting together photos for [my book](https://shifthappens.site/) âÂ I wanted these machines to never feel decrepit, abused, unloved. Itâs the same here. The exhibit is well lit and airy; compared to many other museums where this kind of a setup would be dingy and dusty, this feels almost like a _show room_ , which I appreciated. 

(I missed some plaques explaining things, but also appreciated the minimalism and undisturbed sightlines. The [museum in ÅÃ³dÅº](/fav-tech-museums/#centralne-muzeum-wlokiennictwa), just below, solved it well by giving you a gorgeous book you could refer to. This could be a fun solution here.)

###  Centralne Muzeum WÅÃ³kiennictwa / Central Textile Museum 

ÅÃ³dÅºÂ /Â Visited in 2025 / [cmwl.pl](https://cmwl.pl/public/)

I was pleasantly surprised by this museum in Polandâs rough equivalent of Detroit â once again, blending the old and the new. A live demo of textile machines given by a guy with a certain attitude was fun (opinionated docents almost always are!), but what really impressed me was the book that I was given for free upon entry. Itâs professional, well-written, and made me revisit what I saw and learned in a different way after I left the building.

A simple story: I didnât understand much of the tour because of the language barrier, but I could move around freely and take photos of this fascinating building hosting a 100-year-old engine shed once used by Madridâs metro, and it _was_ fascinating. 

Just the vibes were enough for me.

##  Anti recommendations 

I donât love putting museums on blast because so much of this stuff is contextual, and I might not even be the right customer anyway! So I wanted to talk about a few I didnât like mostly as a way to highlight whatâs important to me and why they didnât work for me â figuring it all out via some negative examples. 

##### Railway Museum (Utrecht)

As I mentioned above, this museum is just okay â but could be so, so great if it cared about density â there are many spaces and corridors here absolutely devoid of anything. You have tons of space and tons of stuff in the collection. Why waste it like this? 

To me it feels important that a museum âmeets your freakâ âÂ if you want to just scan and have fun and take a selfie and leave after 15 minutes, this should work. But there should always be more. There should always be _too much for one visit_ , a certain sense of overwhelm and exhaustion and the depth of history. This doesnât have to be in the amount of exhibits or space to cover, but it could be a _fractal_ â a few exhibits, but each one with a lot of details if you want to go deeper; a few dedicated tours or demos; videos to watch or books to read and come back. 

I know this is not always possible, but âthe second dateâ â coming back to a museum where you already know the ground rules and established some understanding of what a place is and what are its âdimensions,â and you can just revel in details and connecting things together â can be one of the best things ever. 

##### The House of the Book (The Hague)

The thing I mentioned above about âold and creaky and in need to be dustedâ? Thatâs what this museum feels like. They boast being the oldest book-related museum in the world which should feel like heaven, right? But I found this museum mostly kind ofâ¦ lazy, with exhibits that are simple and uninspiring. I can see some people finding it intimate, but to me this is a museum that ran out of energy and care, and exchanged it with pretense. To me, books deserve so much more. 

Maybe whatâs important for me is good combination of creativity and care on display â in putting things together, in designing the exhibits, in even one crucial restoration, in small but meaningful details. 

##### Benjamin Franklin Museum (Philadelphia)

I donât know if this counts as a tech museum, but this was such a miserable experience. One thing I absolutely hate for museums is _being boring_ and this one is an exemplary boring experience: boring exhibits, boring visuals, boring layout. I realized this in the moment, and also later when I noticed I didnât take one single photo, which is rare for me. 

The museum is in a dingy underground space, and it just feels old in that 1970s brutalist way where you canât even appreciate the vintage. I worry itâs these kind of places that give museums a bad name â you visit one on a school trip, and you develop a sense that all museums are a waste of time. 

To perhaps oversimplify the three anti-examples above: I love tech museums that are rich in content, rich in effort, and rich in curiosity â but not necessarily just rich. The 20+ I listed above have all of that in spades, and deserve recognition for that.

Thatâs it! I hope you enjoyed this little tour. I also thought it was fun to look at all the logos of the âgoodâ museums. Theyâre not all perfect, but itâs fun to see the themes emerging â including at least 5 places using the shape of their building in the logo! Many of these feel like logos for subway systems, which is also fun to realize.
