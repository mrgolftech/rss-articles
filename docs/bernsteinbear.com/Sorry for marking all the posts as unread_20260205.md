# Sorry for marking all the posts as unread\n\n**来源:** https://bernsteinbear.com\n**链接:** \n**日期:** Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000\n\n---\n\nI noticed that the URLs were all a little off (had two slashes
              instead of one) and went in and fixed it. I did not think
              everyone's RSS software was going to freak out the way it did.

              PS: this is a special RSS-only post that is not visible on the
              site. Enjoy.
