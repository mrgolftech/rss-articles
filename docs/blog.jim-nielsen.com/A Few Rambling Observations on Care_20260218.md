<p>In this new AI world, “taste” is the thing everyone claims is the new supreme skill.</p>
<p>But I think “care” is the one I want to see in the products I buy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can you measure care?</p>
<p>Does scale drive out care?</p>
<p>If a product conversation is reduced to being arbitrated exclusively by numbers, is care lost?</p>
<p>The more I think about it, care seems antithetical to <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/measurement-and-numbers/">the reductive nature of quantification</a> — “one death is a tragedy, one million is a statistic”.</p>
<hr />
<p>Care considers useful, constructive systematic forces — rules, processes, etc. — but does not take them as law. Individual context and sensitivity are the primary considerations.</p>
<p>That’s why the professional answer to so many questions is: “it depends”.</p>
<p>“This is the law for everyone, everywhere, always” is not a system I want to live in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Businesses exist to make money, so one would assume a business will always act in a way that maximizes the amount of money that can be made.</p>
<p>That’s where numbers take you. They let you measure who is gaining or losing the most quantifiable amount in any given transaction.</p>
<p>But there’s <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2026-02-17T1712">an unmeasurable, unquantifiable principle</a> lurking behind all those numbers: it can be good for business to leave money on the table.</p>
<p>Why? Because you care. You are willing to provision room for something beyond just a quantity, a number, a dollar amount. </p>
<hr />
<p>I don’t think numbers alone can bring you to <em>care</em>. </p>
<p>I mean, how silly is it to say:</p>
<p>“How much care did you put into the product this week?” </p>
<p>“Put me down for a 8 out of 10 this week.”</p>
