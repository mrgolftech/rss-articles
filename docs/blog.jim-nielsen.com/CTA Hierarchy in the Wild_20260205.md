# CTA Hierarchy in the Wild

  * 2026-01-22


The other day I was browsing YouTube — as one does — and I clicked a link in the video description to a book.

I was then subjected to a man-in-the-middle attack, where YouTube put themselves in the middle of me and the link I had clicked:

![Screenshot of a webpage that says “Are you sure you want to leave YouTube?” and there are two buttons. On the left is the secondary, de-emphasized button that says “GO TO SITE” and on the right is the primary, visually emphasized button that says “BACK TO YOUTUBE”.](https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/youtube-are-you-sure.png)

[Hyperlinks are subversive](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/). Big Tech must protect themselves and their interests.

But link hijacking isn’t why I’m writing this post.

What struck me was the ordering and visual emphasis of the “call to action” (CTA) buttons. I almost clicked “Back to YouTube”, which was precisely the action I didn’t want.

I paused and laughed to myself.

Look how the design pattern for primary/secondary user interface controls has inverted over time:

  * Classic software:
    * Primary CTA: what’s best for you
    * Secondary CTA: an alternative for you
  * Modern software:
    * Primary CTA: what’s best for us
    * Secondary CTA: what’s acceptable to us


It seems like everywhere I go, software is increasingly designed _against_ me.
