Re:
A Call for New Aesthetics
.
\n\n
At some point in the 20th century, we filled out the last few basis vectors of\nhumanity. We explored the whole game map. This is what it means to live at the\nend of history: every aesthetic movement, political and economic system you can\nimagine can be understood as a linear combination of things that have come\nbefore. Asking for a new aesthetics is like asking for a new continent, one\nnorth of 90° and with imaginary longitude.
\n\n
This is why culture feels stuck, and why every ideology is “neo” or “post”\nsomething that came before: we have exhausted humanity. And this is why every\nresponse to the call for a new aesthetics is to dig up some past artistic\nmovement, and scale it up linearly. “
We offer nothing new except\ngigantism
”.
\n\n
I don’t want to believe this is true, because I want to believe culture is an\ninfinite game, and inexhaustible. And surely the number of linear\ncombinations—of distinct ideas humans can have, and works of art we can\nmake—is so high as to be inexhaustible. But each new remixing brings less\ninformation than the last.
\n\n
\n
Today, futuristic aesthetics often mean retrofuturistic aesthetics.
\n
\n\n
At the end of history, all futurism is retrofuturism, because the future is\n
contained in
the past. The space age, the atomic age, the age of supersonic\nflight all came and went. Dyson spheres and nanomachines and mind uploading were\ntheorized and written about decades ago.
\n\n
If there is a new aesthetic, it will have to come from a transhuman\nculture—from people who are more than, or at least other than, human—or from\nthe
alien minds
being born around us.
