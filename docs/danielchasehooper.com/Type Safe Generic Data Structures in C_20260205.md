# Type Safe Generic Data Structures in C

June 25, 2025・8 minute read

See my follow-up article: "[A Fast, Growable Array With Stable Pointers in C](/posts/segment_array/)"

I write type safe generic data structures in C using a technique that I haven't seen elsewhere1. It uses unions to associate type information with a generic data structure, but we'll get to that. My approach works for any type of data structure: maps, arrays, binary trees… but for this article I illustrate the ideas by implementing a basic linked list. Since many people aren't aware you can do C generics _at all_ , I figured I'd start simple and build up to this:
    
    
    typedef struct {
        int value;
    } Foo;
        
    List(int) int_list = {0};
    list_prepend(&int_list, 3);
    
    List(Foo) foo_list = {0};
    list_prepend(&foo_list, (Foo){ 5 });
    list_prepend(&foo_list, (Foo){ 3 });
    
    // this won't compile, which is good!
    // list_prepend(&foo_list, 7); 
    
    list_for(item, &foo_list) {
        // `item` is of type `Foo *`
        printf("%i\n", item->value);
    }
    

### Generics level 0: Generic Headers

I hesitate to even mention this, because I do not like it2, but its worth comparing to the technique at the end of this article. It works like this: you write your data structure in a header, using macros for your types, and then `#include` the header multiple times; once for each type the data structure will be used with.

Click to see the Code

`list.h`
    
    
    #ifndef T
    #error "T must be defined before including this header"
    #endif
    
    #define _CONCAT(a, b) a##b
    #define CONCAT(a, b) _CONCAT(a, b)
    
    #define NODE_TYPE CONCAT(T, ListNode)
    #define PREPEND_FUNC CONCAT(T, _list_prepend)
    
    typedef struct NODE_TYPE NODE_TYPE;
    struct NODE_TYPE {
        NODE_TYPE *next;
        T data;
    };
    
    void PREPEND_FUNC(NODE_TYPE **head, T data) {
        NODE_TYPE *node = malloc(sizeof(*node));
        node->data = data;
        node->next = *head;
        *head = node;
    }
    
    #undef T
    #undef _CONCAT
    #undef CONCAT
    #undef NODE_TYPE
    #undef PREPEND_FUNC
    

`main.c`
    
    
    typedef struct {
        int a;
    } Foo;
    
    typedef struct {
        char *str;
        double num;
    } Bar;
    
    #define T Foo
    #include "list.h"
    
    #define T Bar
    #include "list.h"
    
    FooListNode *foo_head = NULL;
    Foo_list_prepend(&foo_head, (Foo){1})
    
    BarListNode *bar_head = NULL;
    Bar_list_prepend(&bar_head, (Bar){"hello", 5.4})
    

  


While it _is_ generic and type safe, it has downsides:

  * makes it hard to find where types and functions are defined (because they're constructed by macros)
  * code completion may not handle them well
  * bloats your binary size and build times with copies of the same functions
  * requires using type-prefixed functions: `Foo_list_prepend() and int_list_prepend()` vs just `list_prepend()`



### Generics level 1: `void *`

Another way to make a data structure generic is to use `void *`. It's not type safe but we'll get to that.
    
    
    typedef struct ListNode ListNode;
    struct ListNode {
        ListNode *next;
        void *data;
    };
    
    void list_prepend(ListNode **head, void *data) {
        ListNode *node = malloc(sizeof(*node));
        node->data = data;
        node->next = *head;
        *head = node;
    }
    

Note: `malloc` is used for familiarity, but I highly recommend Arenas instead. You can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ5a3gCCZYo) or [read](https://www.rfleury.com/p/untangling-lifetimes-the-arena-allocator) about them.

Having `ListNode` and its `data` as separate allocations isn't ideal from a memory and performance perspective. It requires 2 allocations per node when one would do, the `data` pointer uses memory unnecessarily, and you will likely get two cache misses per node when traversing the list: once getting the next node, and once getting its data. We can fix these issues with…

### Generics level 2: Inline storage

Instead of storing a pointer to the node's data, we can use a [Flexible Array Member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member) to store the data inside the node. To do so, we make a single allocation large enough for both the node and the type it stores3:
    
    
    typedef struct ListNode ListNode;
    struct ListNode {
        ListNode *next;
        char data[]; // glossing over some padding/alignment details here
    };
    
    void list_prepend(ListNode **head, 
                     void *data, 
                     size_t data_size) 
    {
        ListNode *node = malloc(sizeof(*node) + data_size);
        memcpy(node->data, data, data_size);
        node->next = *head;
        *head = node;
    }
    
    void main() {
        ListNode *foo_list = NULL;
        Foo foo = {5};
        list_prepend(&foo_list, &foo, sizeof(foo));
    }
    

Now `next` and the actual contents of `data` are beside each other in memory, solving the issues of the `void *` approach. Unfortunately we now have to pass the size, but we'll fix that in the next section

If you wanted to avoid the `memcpy`, and initialize the node's memory directly, you could do so with a `list_alloc_front` function:
    
    
    void *list_alloc_front(ListNode **head, size_t data_size)  {
        ListNode *node = malloc(sizeof(*node) + data_size);
        node->next = *head;
        *head = node;
        return node->data;
    }
    
    Foo *new_foo = list_alloc_front(&foo_list, sizeof(*new_foo));
    new_foo->value = 5;
    

### Generics level 3: Type Checking

The part you've all been waiting for: how to get the compiler to error when we try to add the wrong type to a list. The way I found to do this is to use a union with a `payload` member that has a parameterized type:
    
    
    #define List(type) union { \
        ListNode *head; \
        type *payload; \
    }
    
    List(Foo) foo_list = {0};
    List(int) int_list = {0};
    

How does that help us? Well, we can use the ternary operator to enforce that the `item` parameter is the same type as the list's `payload`:
    
    
    // Note: leading underscore add to the 
    // function name since only the macro should call it
    void _list_prepend(ListNode **head, 
                     void *data, 
                     size_t data_size);
    
    #define list_prepend(list, item) \
        _list_prepend(&((list)->head), \
                      (1 ? (item) : (list)->payload), \
                      sizeof(*(list)->payload)) 
                   
    List(Foo) *foo_list = NULL;
    Bar bar = {5, 6};
    list_prepend(&foo_list, &bar); // error!
    

The macro also handles passing the item size for us! This is the error Clang produces when adding the wrong type to the list:
    
    
    error: pointer type mismatch ('Foo *' and 'Bar *') [-Werror,-Wpointer-type-mismatch]
       38 |     list_prepend(&foo_list, &bar);
          |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    note: expanded from macro 'list_prepend'
       15 |     _list_prepend(&((list)->head), (1 ? (item) : (list)->payload), sizeof(*(list)->payload))
          |    
    

Macros get a bad rep, but I think this is fairly understandable. Some things to note: `payload` is never used at runtime, it exists just for type information at compile time. Using a union makes `payload` not consume any memory.

If you're writing a generic function that needs to return a pointer to contained data, you can use `__typeof__()` to cast the return type from `void *` to the data structure's `payload` type. `__typeof__()` is supported in all three big C compilers (clang, gcc, **and** msvc since version 19.39).
    
    
    #define list_alloc_front(list) \
        (__typeof__((list)->payload))_list_alloc_front(&(list)->head, sizeof(*(list)->payload))
        
    void *_list_alloc_front(ListNode **head) {...}
    

If for some reason you don't like using the ternary operator to ensure two types are the same, a previous version of this article used a different technique:Read the old technique

We can use `__typeof__(foo_list.payload)` to get the type the list contains. We'll write a `list_prepend` macro, which will call `_list_prepend` with a cast function type so that the `void *` parameter is the list's `payload` type
    
    
    // Note: I added a leading underscore to the 
    // function name since only the macro should call it
    void _list_prepend(ListNode **head, 
                     void *data, 
                     size_t data_size);
    
    #define list_prepend(list, item) \
        /* cast function type */ \
        ((void (*)(ListNode **, \
                   __typeof__((list)->payload), \
                   size_t))_list_prepend)  \
                   /* call function */ \
                   (&((list)->head), item, sizeof(*(list)->payload)) 
                   
    List(Foo) *foo_list = NULL;
    Bar bar = {5};
    list_prepend(&foo_list, &bar); // error!
    

Calling a typecast function pointer is technically undefined behavior, but in practice it's fine when compiled by modern compilers targeting modern platforms.

## `typeof` on old compilers

`__typeof__()` was an optional extension until C23, which made it part of the C standard. While Clang and gcc have supported it for a _long_ time, some compilers haven't (like msvc versions prior to 19.39). To make this technique work on those compilers, you can use the terenary operator instead of typeof
    
    
    #define List(type) struct { \
        ListNode *head; \
        type *payload; \
    }
    
    #define list_prepend(list, item) \
        _list_prepend(&((list)->head), (1 ? (item) : (list)->payload), sizeof(*(list)->payload)) 
    

It's possible to do type safe returns as well, by assigning through `payload`, but I'll leave the details as an exercise for the reader. #

  


## Passing a Parameter

One annoying thing about C compilers4 is that they do not consider these two variables to have the same type:
    
    
    List(Foo) a;
    List(Foo) b = a; // error
    
    void my_function(List(Foo) list);
    my_function(a); // error: incompatible type
    

Even though the variables have identical type definitions, the compiler still errors because they are _two distinct definitions_. A `typedef` avoids the issue:
    
    
    typedef List(Foo) ListFoo; // this makes it all work
    
    ListFoo a;
    ListFoo b = a; // ok
    
    void my_function(ListFoo list);
    my_function(a); // ok
    
    List(Foo) local_foo_list; // still works 
    

### Conclusion

You can use this for any type of data structure, even ones with multiple associated types, like a hash map:
    
    
    typedef struct {
        ...
    } MapInternal;
    
    #define Map(key_type, value_type) union { \
        MapInternal map; \
        key_type *key; \
        value_type *value; \
    }

  1. [stb_ds.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_ds.h) is an example of a type-safe generic data structure, but the techniques it uses aren't as general as what I present here - it only works because the array and map are implemented using a c array. The compiler catches some type errors upon assignment to that c array, not at the point that values are passed as parameters to generic functions. i.e. `struct {int a; int b;} baz; STBDS_ADDRESSOF(baz, 5)` compiles successfully, when you really want a type error. ↩︎

  2. If you want to write a generic function that requires type-specific code gen (like generating `add_int` and `add_double` from the same source), this option has more merit. You can get creative with c features in other ways to get type-specific behavior, like for hashing functions, for example. ↩︎

  3. I'm glossing over some information about alignment, padding, and size calculations that come into play with the `data` member, but that's a whole other topic that you should read up on elsewhere if you're unfamiliar. ↩︎

  4. Structurally identical types with the same tag name will be considered the same type in GCC 15 and Clang in late 2025 thanks to a [rule change](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3037.pdf) ↩︎
