{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://daringfireball.net/linked/', 'value': '<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps the most surprising announcement on Thursday was that\nApple and Netflix, which have had a rather stand-offish\nrelationship when it comes to video programming, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/formula-1-apple-netflix-drive-to-survive">have struck a\ndeal to swap some Formula One-related content</a>. Formula One’s\ngrowing popularity in the United States is due, perhaps in large\npart, to the high-profile success of the Netflix docuseries “Drive\nto Survive.” The latest season of that series, debuting Friday,\nwill premiere simultaneously on both Netflix and Apple TV.\nPresumably, in exchange for that non-exclusive, Apple will also\nnon-exclusively allow Netflix to broadcast the Canadian Grand Prix\nin May. (Insert obligatory wish that Apple and Netflix would bury\nthe hatchet and enable Watch Now support in the TV app for Netflix\ncontent.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a crazy cool partnership.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/26/apple-f1-netflix" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces F1 Broadcast Details, and a Surprising Netflix Partnership’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
