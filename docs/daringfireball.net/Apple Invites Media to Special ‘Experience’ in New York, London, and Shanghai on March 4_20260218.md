It is simply described as a\n“special Apple Experience,” and there is no further information\nabout what it may entail. The invitation features a 3D Apple logo\ndesign composed of yellow, green, and blue discs.</p>\n\n<p>It is notable that Apple is specifically using the word\n“experience,” rather than “event.” Unlike a full live-streamed\nevent from Apple Park, the March 4 event in other cities is likely\nto be smaller in scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Among the products expected soon\u2009—\u2009either by annual schedule predictability, or via the rumor mill\u2009—\u2009are the iPhone 17e, an updated iPad Air (going from the M3 to M4), an updated base-model iPad (going from A16 to A18), updated MacBook Pros with the M5 Pro and Max, updated MacBook Airs (going from M4 to M5\u2009—\u2009the M4 models were <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-introduces-the-new-macbook-air-with-the-m4-chip-and-a-sky-blue-color/">released in early March last year</a>), and, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">per Gurman</a>, the long-rumored new lower-cost MacBook with an A18 chip (a “MacBook e”, if you will, although I certainly don’t think that will be the name\u2009—\u2009my guess is Apple will just call it “MacBook” without an adjective).</p>\n\n<p>What strikes me is that March 4\u2009—\u2009the “experience” day\u2009—\u2009is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the “experience” will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos. Spread the announcements out across a few days, but then have in-person events for members of the media to get a hands-on experience with all of them, station-by-station, without needing to produce an Apple Event keynote film.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/17/apple-special-experience-march-4" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Invites Media to Special ‘Experience’ in New York, London, and Shanghai on March 4’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
