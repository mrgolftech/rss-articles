The stock skyrocketed as much as 24%\nin extended trading.</p>\n\n<p>“Today we shared a difficult decision with our team,” Jack\nDorsey, Block’s co-founder and CEO, wrote in a <a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf">letter to\nshareholders</a>. “We’re reducing Block by nearly half, from\nover 10,000 people to just under 6,000, which means that over\n4,000 people are being asked to leave or entering into\nconsultation.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Other companies like Pinterest, CrowdStrike and Chegg have\nrecently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/chegg-slashes-45percent-of-workforce-blames-new-realities-of-ai.html">announced job cuts</a> and directly attributed the\nlayoffs to AI reshaping their workforces.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20">an X post</a>, Dorsey said he was faced with the choice of\nlaying off staffers over several months or years “as this shift\nplays out,” or to “act on it now.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf">Dorsey’s letter to shareholders</a> was properly upper-and-lowercased; his memo to employees, <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=20">which he posted on Twitter/X</a>, was entirely lowercase. That’s a telling sign about who he respects. Dorsey, in that memo to employees:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>we’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble. our\nbusiness is strong. gross profit continues to grow, we continue to\nserve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. but\nsomething has changed. we’re already seeing that the intelligence\ntools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter\nteams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally\nchanges what it means to build and run a company. and that’s\naccelerating rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>i had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this\nshift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it\nnow. i chose the latter. repeated rounds of cuts are destructive\nto morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and\nshareholders place in our ability to lead. i’d rather take a hard,\nclear action now and build from a position we believe in than\nmanage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AI is going to obviate a lot of jobs, in a lot of industries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)">So it goes</a>. But in the case of these tech companies\u2009—\u2009exemplified by Block\u2009—\u2009it’s just a convenient cover story to excuse <a href="https://x.com/BamaBonds/status/2027142091596288314">absurd over-hiring</a> in the last 5–10 years. Say what you want about Elon Musk, but he was absolutely correct that Twitter was carrying a ton of needless employees. This reckoning was coming, and “AI” is just a convenient scapegoat.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/27/block-layoffs" title="Permanent link to ‘Block Lays Off 4,000 (of 10,000) Employees’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
