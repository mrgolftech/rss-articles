Energym
MOVE THE WORLD
​
An interview from 2036 with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman.
After the stock market crash of 2026 the economy faltered, 80% of people lost their job and the US tech elite had to find a new way to keep the world moving: Energym - Human-powered AI systems, fulfilling both the machine’s need for energy and the people’s need for purpose.
​
This mockumentary fragment depicts a dystopian world 10 years from now.
