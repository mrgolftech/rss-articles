{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://daringfireball.net/linked/', 'value': '<p>Tim Hardwick, reporting for MacRumors back on February 12:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c25de53-4668-4ddf-9e28-f8c4fc34940e">seen by the Financial Times</a>, FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson cites recent press coverage of a report from conservative media watchdog Media Research Center (MRC), which claimed that Apple has promoted “leftist outlets” in its content choices.</p>\n\n<p>The report in question by the MRC said that in January, Apple News “refrained from using any right-leaning outlets in the top 20 articles of its morning editions between Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, 2026.” The outlets named in the report include Fox News, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit.</p>\n\n<p>The report went on to claim that Apple News was more favorable to outlets such as The Washington Post, The Associated Press, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal – publications that are traditionally considered either center outlets or nonpartisan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d say they’re more traditionally considered trustworthy news sources, rather than propaganda outlets. Anyway, when you give a bully your lunch money\u2009—\u2009or, say, a 24-karat gold trophy emblazoned with your company’s logo\u2009—\u2009they always come back for more.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/24/ftc-apple-news" title="Permanent link to ‘FTC Chairman Sends Letter to Apple Complaining That MAGA ‘News’ Sources Aren’t Represented in Apple News’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
