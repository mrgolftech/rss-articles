B. Reese (Who Invented Reese’s), built Reese’s\non a simple, enduring architecture: Milk Chocolate + Peanut\nButter. Not a flavor idea. Not a marketing construct. A real,\ntangible product identity that consumers have trusted for a\ncentury.</p>\n\n<p>But today, Reese’s identity is being rewritten, not by\nstorytellers, but by formulation decisions that replace Milk\nChocolate with compound coatings and Peanut Butter with\npeanut‑butter‑style crèmes across multiple Reese’s products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-hershey-chocolate-1a66ec75247fd146888b7a747a740cd3">The Associated Press</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hershey said Wednesday that Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are made\nthe same way they always have been, with milk chocolate and peanut\nbutter that the company makes itself from roasted peanuts and a\nfew other ingredients, including sugar and salt. But some Reese’s\ningredients vary, Hershey said.</p>\n\n<p>“As we’ve grown and expanded the Reese’s product line, we make\nproduct recipe adjustments that allow us to make new shapes, sizes\nand innovations that Reese’s fans have come to love and ask for,\nwhile always protecting the essence of what makes Reese’s unique\nand special: the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut\nbutter,” the company said.</p>\n\n<p>Brad Reese said he thinks Hershey went too far. He said he\nrecently threw out a bag of Reese’s Mini Hearts, which were a new\nproduct released for Valentine’s Day. The packaging notes that the\nheart-shaped candies are made from “chocolate candy and peanut\nbutter crème,” not milk chocolate and peanut butter.</p>\n\n<p>“It was not edible,” Reese told The Associated Press in an\ninterview. “You have to understand. I used to eat a Reese’s\nproduct every day. This is very devastating for me.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Enshittification came for Reese’s Cups (along with just about everything else Hershey makes) long ago. Both the “milk chocolate” and “peanut butter” require <a href="https://linguistlaura.blogspot.com/2012/06/scare-quotes.html">dick quotes</a> around them. Compare and contrast the taste\u2009—\u2009and ingredients list\u2009—\u2009to the peanut butter cups from, say, <a href="https://www.justins.com/products/milk-chocolate-peanut-butter-cups/">Justin’s</a> (who also makes them <a href="https://www.justins.com/products/dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-cups/">with dark chocolate</a>).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/23/brad-reese" title="Permanent link to ‘Grandson of Inventor of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups Goes Public With the Obvious: They Taste Like Shit Now’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
