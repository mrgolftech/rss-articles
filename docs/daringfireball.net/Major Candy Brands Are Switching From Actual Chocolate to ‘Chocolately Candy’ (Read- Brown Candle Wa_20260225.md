Food scientists refer\nto it as “compound chocolate” coating, because it’s made from\nactual cocoa powder, but replaces the more expensive source of fat\n(cocoa butter) with cheaper, lower-quality vegetable fats. When\nHershey brands such as Mr. Goodbar or Almond Joy made the switch\nin recent years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/climate/candy-chocolate-cocoa-prices-climate-change.html">their labels subtly changed</a> from claiming\nthat they were “milk chocolate,” to “chocolate candy,” which\nstrikes me as particularly insidious phrasing. A more obvious\nindicator is another word that many companies use: “Chocolatey”\ncoating. Wondering how much this scourge had infiltrated my own\nhome, I took a look moments ago at several packages of Girl Scout\nCookies, only to find the inevitable: Both my Thin Mints and\nPeanut Butter Patties are also made with compound chocolate,\nrather than the real thing. I can hardly pretend to be surprised.\nEven in candies that continue to use real chocolate, meanwhile,\ncost-cutting measures have sometimes been employed, such as the\nmilk chocolate coating of a Snickers bar becoming slightly thinner\nover time. Some products even mix real chocolate and compound\nchocolate in a single cookie or candy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/25/from-chocolate-to-wax" title="Permanent link to ‘Major Candy Brands Are Switching From Actual Chocolate to ‘Chocolately Candy’ (Read: Brown Candle Wax)’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
