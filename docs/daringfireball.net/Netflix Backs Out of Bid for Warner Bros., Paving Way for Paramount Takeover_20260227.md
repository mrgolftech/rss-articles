Discovery, a stunning development that paves\nthe way for the storied Hollywood media giant to end up under the\ncontrol of a rival bidder, the technology heir David Ellison.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix said that it would not raise its offer to counter a higher\nbid made earlier this week by Mr. Ellison’s company, Paramount\nSkydance, adding in a statement that “the deal is no longer\nfinancially attractive.”</p>\n\n<p>“This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price,\nnot a ‘must have’ at any price,” the Netflix co-chief executives,\nTed Sarandos and Greg Peters, said in a statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/">Netflix’s stock</a> is <em>up</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2026/02/nflx-after-hours.png">9 percent</a> in after-hours trading. This is like when you have a friend (Netflix) dating a good-looking-but-crazy person (Warner Bros.), and the good-looking-but-crazy person does something to give your friend second thoughts. You tell your friend to run away.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/26/netflix-backs-out-of-warner-bros-acquisition" title="Permanent link to ‘Netflix Backs Out of Bid for Warner Bros., Paving Way for Paramount Takeover’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
