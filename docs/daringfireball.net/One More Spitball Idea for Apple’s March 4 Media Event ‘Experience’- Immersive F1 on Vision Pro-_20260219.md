You will recall from October <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/apple-formula-1">that Apple TV is now the exclusive broadcast partner for F1 in the U.S.</a> Apple is already dabbling with live immersive sports broadcasting for VisionOS <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/17/apple-formula-1">with a limited slate of Lakers games this season</a>. If they have something planned for streaming F1 races live on Vision Pro, with some level of immersion, March 4 would be a pretty good date to demo that experience to the media.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t even have to be <em>live</em> race coverage. Technically that’s probably impossible for this season. It would just be a sign of confidence and interest in the platform long-term merely to see <em>some</em> sort of immersive component to F1 on Apple TV, even if it’s not live. Like “ride the track” to experience the turns and elevation changes.</p>\n\n<p>Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event. But it seems worth noting.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/18/immersive-f1-vision-pro-spitball" title="Permanent link to ‘One More Spitball Idea for Apple’s March 4 Media Event ‘Experience’: Immersive F1 on Vision Pro?’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
