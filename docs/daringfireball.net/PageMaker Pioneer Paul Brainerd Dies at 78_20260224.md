He was 78 years old.</p>\n\n<p>He left two legacies. The first was a piece of software that put\nthe power of the printed page into the hands of millions of people\nwho had never operated a typesetting machine. The second was a\nthree-decade commitment to environmental conservation and\nphilanthropy in the Pacific Northwest, pursuing it with the same\nintensity he brought to the desktop publishing revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Friends and colleagues this week remembered Brainerd as a quiet,\ncaring and detail-oriented leader with exacting standards. He\ninsisted that PageMaker use proper curly quotation marks instead\nof straight ones, and obsessed over nuances such as kerning, the\nprecise spacing between specific letter pairs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PageMaker was years ahead of its time, and was essential to igniting the desktop publishing revolution.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/24/paul-brainerd-rip" title="Permanent link to ‘PageMaker Pioneer Paul Brainerd Dies at 78’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
