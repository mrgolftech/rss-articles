At its default setting, it definitely\nworks, but the contents of the display are visible at less-sharp\nangles. Samsung has a “maximum” setting that takes this up a\nnotch, and that setting makes it even harder to see the contents\nand narrows the field-of-view even further. [...]</p>\n\n<p>A bigger deal, though, is that Samsung has built Privacy Display\nwith the ability to only apply to small portions of the Galaxy S26\nUltra’s display. Specifically, it can hide your notification\npop-ups. This part really impressed me, as Privacy Display is able\nto specifically hide only that singular portion of the display,\nand it does so nearly perfectly. The masking around the\nnotification ensures the content behind isn’t affected, and the\neffect works incredibly well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neat feature, especially the way you can toggle it when needed, set it to auto-enable for specific apps, and/or work only for notifications.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/25/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultras-privacy-display" title="Permanent link to ‘Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra’s Privacy Display’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
