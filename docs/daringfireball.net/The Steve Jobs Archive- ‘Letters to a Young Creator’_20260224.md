{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://daringfireball.net/linked/', 'value': '<p>Laurene Powell Jobs, in her introduction to the newest publication from the Steve Jobs Archive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Among the books that mattered to Steve was Rilke’s <em>Letters to a\nYoung Poet</em>. I’m struck by this line from its pages: “Live the\nquestions for now. Perhaps then you will gradually, without\nnoticing it, live your way into the answer, one distant day in the\nfuture.”</p>\n\n<p>This is a time to live your questions. The beauty of answers, when\nthey do come, is that they allow us to ask new and better\nquestions. Life is learning how much we have yet to learn. In this\nvolume, we have asked distinguished creators of diverse fields to\nshare some of their answers to questions you asked at the\nbeginning of your fellowship year. You’ll find candid stories of\nstruggle and success, mistakes, and milestones. The wisdom they\nshare in their reflections was forged by asking the kinds of\nquestions you’re asking now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Carve out some time for this collection. It’s also available as <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/letters-to-a-young-creator/id6759349977">an ebook from Apple Books</a> or <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/publications">EPUB download</a> from SJA’s publications page.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/24/sja-letters-to-a-young-creator" title="Permanent link to ‘The Steve Jobs Archive: ‘Letters to a Young Creator’’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
