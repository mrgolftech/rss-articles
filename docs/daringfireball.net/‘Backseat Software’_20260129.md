You’re driving\nsomewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few\nminutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the\nroad and asks:</p>\n\n<p><em>“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”</em></p>\n\n<p>Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you\ndismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.</p>\n\n<p>A minute later it does it again.</p>\n\n<p><em>“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”</em></p>\n\n<p>It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn\nsignal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away\nuntil you demonstrate mastery.</p>\n\n<p>Ridiculous, of course.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because\nit’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model\nthat would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve started to think of this as <em>backseat software</em>: the slow\nshift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel\nthat operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s\nremarkably hard to keep it quiet.</p>\n\n<p>This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One\nreasonable step at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If that lede pulls you in, like it did for me, you’re going to love the rest of the essay. This is one for the ages. It’s so good.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/29/backseat-software" title="Permanent link to ‘‘Backseat Software’’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
