It was a period of\nspectacular failures, near-bankruptcy, and brutal humiliation. But\nout of this crucible of defeat emerged the visionary leader who\nwould go on to create the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming\nApple into the most valuable company on earth.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on previously unpublished materials and new interviews\nwith the key players, Geoffrey Cain reveals the untold story of\nSteve Jobs’s “lost decade”\u2009—\u2009the formative years that shaped the\nicon we thought we knew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Afterword by Ed Catmull, who was obviously intimately familiar with Jobs in that era. And <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gcain_steve-jobs-in-exile-activity-7417566817008775169-xNQf/">via Cain’s post on LinkedIn</a> announcing the book, the foreword is by NeXT cofounder Dan’l Lewin.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/26/steve-jobs-in-exile" title="Permanent link to ‘‘Steve Jobs in Exile’’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>'}
