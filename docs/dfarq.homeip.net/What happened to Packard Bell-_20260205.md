#  What happened to Packard Bell?

__[Dave Farquhar](https://dfarq.homeip.net/author/admin/ "Dave Farquhar") __[Retro Computing](https://dfarq.homeip.net/category/retro-computing/) __[__ January 30, 2026January 30, 2026](https://dfarq.homeip.net/happened-packard-bell/ "6:00 am") [__2 Comments](https://dfarq.homeip.net/happened-packard-bell/#comments)

What happened to Packard Bell computers? The firm ceased operations in the United States in 2000. Its former rival, Acer, acquired the brand January 31, 2008 for $46 million. It was a once-unimaginable outcome for what had been the top-selling computer brand in the United States.

But there's more to the story than that. The Packard Bell story is a brilliant piece of marketing. The computers were terrible, but the marketing was as good as it gets. And that's one of the reasons people remember it as one of the more prominent of the [90s computer brands](https://dfarq.homeip.net/90s-computer-brands/), even if many who remember it don't remember it fondly.

## Packard Bell thrived on brand confusion

[![What happened to Packard Bell](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/packard_bell_coffee_mug-1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1)](https://dfarq.homeip.net/happened-packard-bell/packard_bell_coffee_mug-2/)This promotional coffee mug features the slogan "America grew up listening to us. It still does." The slogan encouraged people to think of an upstart as an old company. It dates to the late 1980s or early 1990s. What happened to Packard Bell? Bad quality caught up with it.

In 1986, Packard Bell was the name of a defunct manufacturer of TVs and radios. Founded in 1926 or 1933 depending on how you count it, it survived until 1968 when it sold out to Teledyne.

In the 1980s the brand still had some name recognition on its own. But look at the other names it resembled: Pacific Bell, the telephone company. [Hewlett Packard](https://dfarq.homeip.net/packard-bell-vs-hewlett-packard/), the computer company. Packard, the defunct maker of luxury cars.

It sounded like an old-line company making quality products, which was what Beny Alagem counted on. He even put the slogan "America grew up listening to us. It still does," on its early marketing literature.

People always confused them for something they weren't, and for a time, it helped. "I don't know about other brands," one customer said to me when I was selling computers in 1994, pointing at Compaq and Dell. "But Packard Bell, that's an old company." Even my coworkers routinely thought Packard Bell was related to HP or to Packard, the car maker.

Brand resurrections [don't always work](https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-this-latest-attempt-to-resurrect-the-commodore-brand-will-probably-flop/). But this one was one of the more successful ones in history, better than [Atari](https://dfarq.homeip.net/is-atari-still-in-business/) but not quite as good as [DeWalt](https://dfarq.homeip.net/origin-of-dewalt-tools/). I think this one worked because there were multiple factors involved.

## Packard Bell's industrial design

[![What happened to Packard Bell](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/375px-Packard_Bell_Multimedia_D160.jpg?resize=188%2C300&ssl=1)![What happened to Packard Bell](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20188%20300%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://dfarq.homeip.net/happened-packard-bell/375px-packard_bell_multimedia_d160/)This Packard Bell D160 dates to the mid 1990s. The gray panel accents, created by Frog Design, were innovative for the time. Also note the updated logo.

For about the first seven years, Packard Bell computers were generic-looking clones, but in 1994 they started changing things up. They had been one of the first companies to try to make desktop PCs smaller. And in 1994 when everyone was selling beige boxes, they brought in a firm called Frog Design to revamp their cases with different colors and even changing form factors including an [unorthodox L-shaped corner design](https://dfarq.homeip.net/packard-bell-corner-pc/).

Was it great design? Ask an industrial designer. But I have to give them credit for trying. At the very least, their computers had a distinctive look. I will say my graphic design professor in college, Dr. Birgit Wassmuth, who was a _huge_ admirer of Apple and SGI, called out Packard Bell by name for trying to make computers that weren't boring beige boxes. At the time, their designs were more bold than anything even Apple dared. From her perspective, here was a firm giving SGI-like designs at a rock-bottom price.

But it takes more than industrial design to make great computers. What happened to Packard Bell? One of my classmates answered Dr. Wassmuth: "Packard BELL? They make the lowest quality computers you can buy!"

Dr. Wassmuth diplomatically said she could only comment on the industrial design. She was a professor of design, not electrical engineering.

It would have been a brilliant move, but instead, it was more like a last hurrah before their quality issues started catching up with them.

## Quality, or lack thereof

Early on, Packard Bell PCs were OK. Their XT- and 286-class PCs lacked pizzazz, but by and large gave average reliability for a low price. That was largely because they were rebadged machines made by other OEMs, such as Samsung. By the 386SX era though, they were cheap and unreliable. And they stayed that way.

The price meant they sold well. Very well, well enough to overtake [Tandy](https://dfarq.homeip.net/what-happened-to-tandy-computers/) as the best-selling brand of computer in North America. Typically they [cost a couple hundred dollars less](https://dfarq.homeip.net/15-years-ago-at-the-home-of-the-blue-shirts/) than a comparable PC from Hewlett Packard, [Compaq](https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-did-compaq-fail/) (then a separate company), [Dell](https://dfarq.homeip.net/history-of-dell-computers/), or [IBM](https://dfarq.homeip.net/the-ibm-ps1-or-ibm-ps1/). When I worked at [Best Buy](https://dfarq.homeip.net/memories-of-the-land-of-blue-shirts/) in the mid 1990s, Packard Bell may have accounted for 50% of our computer sales, on its own.

The problem was that if there was a corner to cut, they cut it. With exactly one exception. Since they put Intel CPUs in their PCs, they benefited from Intel's "Intel Inside" marketing campaign. Even some CIOs thought a Packard Bell computer with an Intel CPU in it was better than anything with an [AMD](https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-i-generally-buy-amd/) or [Cyrix](https://dfarq.homeip.net/cyrix-processor-chips/) chip in it. It wasn't true, but it proves how well those marketing campaigns worked together. Our local Compaq sales rep hated Intel for it, and that was why Compaq gave startup cash to Intel competitors like [Nexgen](https://dfarq.homeip.net/amds-acquisition-of-nexgen/). Compaq made better machines and didn't appreciate Intel telling everyone otherwise.

Everything else inside a Packard Bell computer was lowest-bidder. Making matters worse, the power supplies tended to be weird form factors so you couldn't replace them with a $40 off-the-shelf unit when they failed, which was often. A replacement OEM unit cost $200 and would fail just as quickly as the old one did. Some of their motherboards were NLX form factor, which was expensive but replaceable. Others were weird form factors with no off the shelf replacement. Part of this was due to Packard Bell's unique industrial design. The computers looked good, but it limited what parts you could use to fix them.

Poor quality doesn't have to be a death sentence. [Gateway 2000](https://dfarq.homeip.net/bought-gateway-computers/) sold PCs that were below average in quality. People bought them anyway because Gateway had great customer service. Packard Bell combined below-average quality with lousy customer service. I personally took a lot of phone calls from Packard Bell buyers. It was easier to call the store for answers than the manufacturer. We got more repeat customers than Packard Bell did.

## Packard Bell's many sad returns

I avoided Packard Bell when I sold computers because I wanted to sell solutions that would last. I saw how many of their computers came back. Officially, it was 1 in 6 sold. Industry average at the time was 1 in 12.

Sometimes they came back with a good story. Early in the 386 era, computers came with keys. You could lock them to keep someone from turning them on without permission.

Well, someone bought one, brought it home, set it up, and couldn't make it work. So they brought it back. "I followed the instructions perfectly," he said. "Then I turned the key and nothing happened!"

It's a computer, not a lawnmower. The key story remained a running joke for years.

But more often than not, there was no humorous story involved. Just an unhappy customer who got buyer's remorse in less than four weeks. The hope was that customer service could talk them into an exchange rather than a refund.

### Stores' policies toward Packard Bell

I worked at Best Buy for a couple of years. Our main competitor, Circuit City, also carried them. The two stores' attitudes toward Packard Bell was very different. Circuit City would advertise Packard Bell computers in the Sunday papers, but if you came into the store, they trashed talked Packard Bell, in hopes of getting you to buy an [AST](https://dfarq.homeip.net/ast-research-computers/) instead. And truthfully? They didn't have to lie. They could honestly say you were twice as likely to have a major problem with a Packard Bell computer than any other brand.

Best Buy's policy was to position Packard Bell in a good-better-best lineup. Packard Bell was (allegedly) good. Acer was better. Compaq, Dell (or HP), and IBM were best.

I pushed other brands because I wanted to sleep at night. If a customer came in with their mind set on Packard Bell, I'd load one up on a cart for them. But if they wanted to talk about it, I directed them toward better brands. I never said anything bad about Packard Bell, but I gave nonverbal cues. I sold a lot of computers, but very few Packard Bells. Some of my coworkers flat out lied about Packard Bell quality. I'm not sure if they knew they were lying or were just repeating what they'd heard someone else say. But I wanted to sleep at night so I wouldn't do that.

The favored line, when a customer said they heard Packard Bell computers were bad, was to say they may have had problems in the past, but they'd come a long way, and then offer an extended warranty. Sorry, a "performance guarantee."

What happened to Packard Bell was that eventually, the lies didn't work anymore. Once Compaq released its [Presario line](https://dfarq.homeip.net/compaq-presario-born-aug-27-1993/) which narrowed the price difference, there was little reason to buy the lower quality machine.

## Few repeat buyers

Not many people bought a second Packard Bell. They'd get a $1,500 bundle-which was cheap for the time-and when the computer broke, they'd buy a different brand and reuse the monitor and printer and whatever was left in the machine that still worked. Frequently the memory, CD-ROM drive, and sound card could be salvaged and re-used in a new PC.

Packard Bell consistently received bad ratings from the [PC magazines like _PC World_](https://dfarq.homeip.net/rest-in-peace-pc-world/) and _PC Magazine_ and from consumer magazines like _Consumer Reports_. But the final blow was the 1995 revelation in that Packard Bell routinely sold "new" PCs with recycled parts in them. That year, Packard Bell merged with NEC, the Japanese electronics maker. Some hoped that would mean better quality and lower prices due to the increased volume. The synergy didn't happen. By 2000, NEC pulled the name off the market.

Packard Bell survived longer in Europe, though in name only as a division of Acer. Acer acquired Packard Bell on January 31, 2008 for a mere $46 million. Speculation at the time was that Acer bought Packard Bell to keep Lenovo from getting the brand name and using it to expand into Europe. In Europe, the name wasn't as tarnished at it had become in the United States. Acer also owned the Gateway and [Emachines](https://dfarq.homeip.net/emachines-never-obsolete-pcs-more-than-a-meme/) brands.

Acer sold the North American rights to the Packard Bell name to Southern Telecom Inc. in 2015, and licensed use of the brand in Africa to Universal Exports Group Ltd in 2019. As of early 2026, the Packard Bell trademark is live and registered in the United States. But the only Packard Bell-branded computer equipment I could find for sale anywhere in North America was a line of monitors.

## Vintage Packard Bell computers as hobbyist machines today

Of course, some vintage Packard Bell computers survive today. Not all of them failed early. And to be fair, if they survived the warranty period, they were likely to be just fine. But relative to the number of machines sold, they're pretty rare today. And if you're looking for a project, a broken Packard Bell is as good as any. A skilled hobbyist can replace the failed components in the power supply and on the motherboard with high quality equivalents and make a vintage Packard Bell about as good as any other PC.

Like I said, Packard Bell was a brilliant stroke of marketing. But since they backed it up with poor quality and poor customer service, it turned into a flash in the pan, even more of a fly-by-night than the low price leader they displaced, [Commodore](https://dfarq.homeip.net/irving-gould-commodore/). Low prices and nice design and brand recognition couldn't overcome the industry-worst quality. So that's what happened to Packard Bell.

Packard Bell was a notch or two below eMachines? That's a tough sell. 🙂 I always considered eMachines to be what would happen if you took Packard Bell's race to the bottom to its logical conclusion.

My recollection of the time was that someone would go to the store and come home with a Packard Bell bundle -- a desktop multimedia PC, keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Everything was thin plastic. The industrial design of the PC was actually kind of interesting, but the flimsy gray cosmetic panels exuded cheapness. The mouse weighed nothing and felt like it would crack open when clicked too hard. The monitor was fuzzy and flickered, because the dot pitch was awful and it couldn't run at high refresh rates. So initial impressions weren't great.

And then I would get asked to help set up the sound card and modem. That's where my hatred came from. They used Aztech sound cards -- which, shockingly, today have a decent reputation. I have not, myself, recovered from that experience, but I guess they're technically not that bad. I mostly remember them being quirky and hard to get working. My Sound Blaster Pro … you set the jumpers (if they even needed to be changed), installed the software, and off you went. On the Aztech, maybe you got one that had that "EEPROM or Software" jumper that selected whether it would be configured at boot by a driver, or used the settings that were previously programmed. That was a whole layer of confusion that nobody asked for.

Then, what card do you even have? The NX? The NX Pro? The NX Pro Extra? The NX Pro 16? The NX Pro 16 Extra? The Pro 16? The Multimedia Pro 16? The Multimedia Pro 16V? AGGGGHHH It wouldn't have been a problem if it didn't matter, but it did. The software wasn't universal, and the drivers would sometimes load, but wouldn't work quite right. Maybe it wouldn't set the IRQ correctly and your Windows startup sound would loop infinitely, or it would lock up. I hated those cards so much. I would tell people, "sorry, this is a write-off -- go buy a Sound Blaster."

Even worse were the ones with modems built in -- because then, you had an awful sound card AND an awful modem. Go buy a Sound Blaster and a USRobotics modem. So much for the value proposition…

The PCs themselves didn't seem all that bad. They pioneered the era of bloatware, but otherwise worked OK, and the stuff inside was the same stuff you got anywhere else. Intel CPUs, Panasonic/MKE optical drives, Conner hard drives …. The motherboards were often just Intel reference designs, albeit in a weird shape that you couldn't replace with another off-the-shelf board -- and, OK, at the time, I held that as a reason not to buy one. But I was young and idealistic. None of those people were going to go hand-select a case, motherboard, RAM, CPU, hard drive, video card . . . . None of them were going to take the 50% BOM that was standard kit and put it in a new computer later, either, so it didn't really matter whether or not they could. They weren't ever going to. They were just going to use it until they couldn't anymore, and then replace it with something entirely different. MAYBE they would take the entire computer to a store and transfer the hard drive over. Maybe. If they even knew that was a thing that could be done. But probably not. Instead, they would buy a box of disks and copy a few important files over before they gave the whole thing to a family member.

Packard Bell customers were not aficionados. And I think, honestly, that may have been the biggest problem. They weren't savvy with computers. They didn't know how to navigate Windows 3.1, they didn't know what a CONFIG.SYS is or does, and they didn't know why a Pentium from Packard Bell was so much more affordable than a Pentium from IBM. They just knew that it was. And it came with, like, a hundred CD-ROM discs, so it must just be a really good deal.

I think THAT was the biggest problem. Packard Bell didn't really fail because the computers weren't good. They failed because they lowered the barrier to entry enough that anyone could buy a computer. And "anyone" did. We hadn't yet cleaned the place up enough for them to thrive, though.

Everything else that we criticized them for, was stuff that would become normal later. Cheap plastic. Off-brand sound cards and modems. Low-res monitors. Overwhelmed customer support. Proprietary case/motherboard/PSU pairings. Even "reconditioned" parts, likely returned because someone who could convince themselves to spend $1500 on a PC had no idea what to do with a $1500 PC, and decided it wasn't worth their time to figure out. The higher prices of better computers weeded out the window-shoppers, and ensured a base level of enthusiasm. And, sure, maybe a slightly better quality PSU.
