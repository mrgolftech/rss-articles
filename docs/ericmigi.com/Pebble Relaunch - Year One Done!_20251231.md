I can’t believe it’s only been 11 months since Google open sourced PebbleOS and the relaunch project began in earnest. It’s been so amazing to see everything come back to life - a
very rare treat
in the tech world!
Since January, we’ve accomplished a lot:
Modernized
PebbleOS
, updating it to support two new chipsets (
nRF52840 and Sifli
)
Announced 2 new
watches
and
Index 01
Released a new,
open source
Pebble app
for iOS and Android (which supports all older Pebble watches as well!)
Manufactured and shipped 6,000 Pebble 2 Duos
Designed and getting close to starting production of Pebble Time 2
Updated the
Pebble SDK
(hello Python 3!) and released a new
way to create Pebble apps in your browser
Started a podcast called
Tick Talk
I personally feel incredibly lucky to get to work on this project every day. Thank you to everyone in the community for supporting this effort!
Pebble Time 2 Production Update
#
Quick end-of-year update! I got back from a super short 60 hour trip to visit the PT2 factory right before Christmas (
follow my travelogue
). I reviewed final pre-production PT2 units and signed ‘golden samples’ that will be used to verify that production units pass our quality inspection standards.
Currently the factory is in the middle of final waterproof and button press testing. We will get both wrapped soon and enter mass production. While there, I clicked
tons and tons of buttons
to nail down the tactile click-feel.
Our production schedule is the same as in the
last update
: we
may
manufacture the first few thousand units before Chinese New Year, but the majority will be produced after the holiday. We’ll start shipping the majority of Pebble Time 2s in March.
If you placed a Pebble Time 2 pre-order, please select watch your colour (if you haven’t done so) on
orders.repebble.com
.
Ringing in 2026

It’s time to get excited for the new year! This will be a big year - we’ll ship Pebble Time 2 and Index 01, builds
tons of new software features
and continue to grow the Pebble community
We’ve also got some new things in the works - starting with a new product announcement tomorrow! Check out
rePebble.com
on January 2 at 7am PST (see the countdown on the site for your local time).
For the first time ever, Pebble has a booth at CES! If you’re at the show, come visit us next week at the Venetian Expo, Hall G — 60247 — Eureka Park. Come say hi and check out our latest products. Plus we’ll be giving away t-shirts and stickers!
Later in January, we’ll be publishing a major update to the Pebble SDK that incorporates
Moddable
’s embedded Javascript SDK. We’re also working on the foundation for Index 01’s ‘actions’, which will find their way to our watches as well. Lots more to come!
Happy new year!
Eric
