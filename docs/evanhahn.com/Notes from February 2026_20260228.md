<p>Things I did and saw this February.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-made">Things I made</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I shipped my first feature at Ghost: <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/inbox-links/">Inbox Links</a>. When a member enters their email to log in or sign up, we now show a button that takes them straight to their inbox. In addition to shipping a neat feature, I also enjoyed learning about MX records and RFC-compliant email address parsing. The source code for the main logic is <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/d71c0bb6e4bf947437ee7e8559fac506a9c77bb7/ghost/core/core/server/lib/get-inbox-links.ts">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was surprised to learn that gzip streams encode which operating system did the compression. <a href="https://evanhahn.com/introducing-gzpeek/">I built a little tool, &ldquo;gzpeek&rdquo;, to inspect this metadata (and more).</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 40th anniversary of the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> was this month, and I wanted a calendar feed for other game anniversaries, so <a href="https://evanhahn.com/zelda-anniversary-calendar/">I made one</a>. <em>Oracle of Ages</em> and <em>Oracle of Seasons</em> just turned 25 yesterday! Speaking of, <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/author/evan-hahn/">I wrote a few articles for Zelda Dungeon</a> as usual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cool-links-from-online">Cool links from online</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <em>incredible</em> stunt: <a href="https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/">a game written in HTML and CSS</a>. &ldquo;No JavaScript or server-side code is used.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best description of LLMs I&rsquo;ve seen so far: <a href="https://social.coop/@DrewKadel/110154048390452046">&ldquo;When you enter text into [ChatGPT], you&rsquo;re asking &lsquo;What would a response to this sound like?&rsquo;&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like it&rsquo;s better for your programming career to be bullish on AI, according to <a href="https://leaddev.com/career-development/ai-skepticism-is-a-quiet-career-killer">&ldquo;AI skepticism is a quiet career killer&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://restofworld.org/2026/big-tech-backlash-alternatives-upscrolled/">&ldquo;Countries are growing uneasy about their dependence on US technology firms&rdquo;</a>, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-orders-diplomats-fight-data-sovereignty-initiatives-2026-02-25/">the US is trying to stop</a>. We deserve to lose this battle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://netwars.pelicancrossing.net/2026/02/06/in-search-of-the-future-internet/">&ldquo;The lack of European billion-dollar technology companies leads people to forget the technology invented here that instead embraced openness: the web, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Open StreetMap, the Fediverse.&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/09/how-a-decades-old-video-game-has-helped-me-defeat-the-doomscroll">decided to pick up a retro video game instead of doom scrolling</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about paranoia. It&rsquo;s about understanding the trade-offs we make when we leave wireless radios enabled on our devices. For some use cases, Bluetooth is essential. For others, it&rsquo;s just convenience. Being aware of what you&rsquo;re exposing is the first step to making informed decisions about which category your devices fall into.&rdquo; From <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/2026-bluetooth-privacy-bluehood/">&ldquo;What Your Bluetooth Devices Reveal About You&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.kayssel.com/newsletter/issue-20/">&ldquo;I want to break down how [Content Security Policy] actually works and, more importantly, where people screw it up.&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/17/tech-companies-traditional-ai-generative-climate-breakdown-report">&ldquo;The research [&hellip;] did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google&rsquo;s Gemini or Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot were leading to a &lsquo;material, verifiable, and substantial&rsquo; reduction in planet-heating emissions.&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First read the term &ldquo;openwashing&rdquo;, which describes the process of using the word &ldquo;open&rdquo; as marketing. OpenAI and Android are examples of this. See <a href="https://tante.cc/2026/02/20/acting-ethical-in-an-imperfect-world/">&ldquo;Acting ethically in an imperfect world&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you had a good February.</p>
