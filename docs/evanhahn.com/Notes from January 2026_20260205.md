# Notes from January 2026

by [Evan Hahn](/), posted Jan 31, 2026

Happy new year! Here are some of my notes from the first month of 2026.

## New job at Ghost!

I started a new job as a Staff Engineer at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) this month. According to our homepage, Ghost is "for professional publishers to create, share, and grow a business around their content." I'm looking forward to building software for independent journalists.

This is also the third time in a row I've chosen to work for a nonprofit. It's a pattern now: nonprofits are my default choice of where to work.

## Things I did

  * [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) does "fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression". I published [libdeflate.js](https://codeberg.org/EvanHahn/libdeflate.js), which wraps it up for JavaScript users. Always feels good to use a little WebAssembly.

  * I recently set every single option in [my Vim configuration](https://codeberg.org/EvanHahn/dotfiles/src/commit/b33b8a10e687b35c06456fe763232af8349c7a39/home/vim/.config/nvim/init.vim), and blogged about it in ["I set all 376 Vim options and I'm still a fool"](/i-set-all-376-vim-options-and-im-still-a-fool/). Even though I learned a lot setting every flag, I still feel far from mastering an editor I've used for almost 14 years. There was some good discussion on [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/0ashr1), [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1qepll2/), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46652690).

  * While everyone else is using state-of-the-art chatbots, I'm using [an LLM that's 7500 times stupider](/an-llm-thats-7500x-stupider/).

  * I read [_On Writing Well_](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/on-writing-well-william-zinsser) by William Zinsser and [published my notes](/on-writing-well-book-notes/). Zinsser's writing isn't to my taste, but I still learned a lot from this book.

  * To approximate the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit, double it and add 30. For the reverse, subtract 30 and halve it. For example, if it's 12ºC, this heuristic would return 54ºF: (12 × 2) + 30 = 54. The actual amount is not far off: 53.6ºF. For more, see ["A mental math heuristic to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius"](/fahrenheit-celsius-heuristic/).

  * I swear by ["Learn X in Y minutes"](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), a great website that offers quick tours of programming languages. I'm proud to have contributed [a page on Rink](https://learnxinyminutes.com/rink/), a powerful command line calculator I've [gushed about previously](/rink-cheatsheet/).

  * Like every month, [I published a few articles over at Zelda Dungeon](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/author/evan-hahn/).




## Links and bookmarks

  * "The calendar turns, and once again a lively procession of books, images, films, and music leaves copyright behind and steps into the ever-growing public domain!" I celebrated [Public Domain Day](https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/) by reading Agatha Christie's [_Murder at the Vicarage_](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie/the-murder-at-the-vicarage).

  * From ["Everything You Need to Know About Email Encryption in 2026"](https://soatok.blog/2026/01/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-email-encryption-in-2026/): "You have virtually no email privacy. They're like postcards, not envelopes."

  * Shoutout to Minneapolis for its [strike against the ICE occupation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/23/minnesota-economic-blackout-ice-protests), and shoutout to [General Strike US](https://bsky.app/profile/generalstrikeus.bsky.social/post/3m76lyeczhk2k), and the [National Shutdown](https://nationalshutdown.org/).

  * Speaking of ICE, [they're requesting "ad tech" data for surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-asks-companies-about-ad-tech-and-big-data-tools/).

  * "What has Meta itself observed about the harms tied to its products?" Turns out, [a lot](https://metasinternalresearch.org/).

  * I knew about [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/), an invaluable index of browser support for various web APIs. But this month, I learned about [Can I email](https://www.caniemail.com/), a counterpart for email clients.

  * Learned [several tricks about the `less` command](https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/).

  * [A mascot for JavaScript!](https://javascript-mascot.github.io/)

  * "In American cities, for example: though at first the automobile enabled humans to travel further distances, it now _demanded_ that humans travel those distances, and _demanded_ infrastructure be created & maintained to enable it." From ["A website to destroy all websites"](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/).

  * ["Who owns your data?"](https://werd.io/who-owns-your-data/) argues that it could be useful to think of personal data as property, from a legal perspective.




Hope you had a good January.
