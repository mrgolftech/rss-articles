<p>The original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> came out 40 years ago today. With other birthdays on the horizon, like <em>Twilight Princess</em>&rsquo;s 20th in November, I wanted a calendar that showed the anniversary of every <em>Zelda</em> game. So I made one.</p>
<p>Subscribe to this URL in your calendar app:</p>
<pre><code>https://evanhahn.com/tape/zelda_anniversaries.ics
</code></pre>
<p>Once you do, you&rsquo;ll get calendar events on the anniversary of each game&rsquo;s release. For example, you&rsquo;ll be able to see that the <em>Oracle</em> games turn 25 in less than a week&hellip;I feel old.</p>
<p>If you want to build this file yourself, <a href="https://evanhahn.com/blog/script.py.txt">I wrote a little Python script that generates an ICS file from a CSV of release dates</a>.</p>
