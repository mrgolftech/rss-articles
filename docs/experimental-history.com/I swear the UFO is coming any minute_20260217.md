Up to half of the attendees at cult meetings may have been undercover researchers. One of them became a leader in the cult and encouraged other members to make statements that would look good in the book. After the failed prediction, rather than doubling down, some of the cultists walked back their statements or left altogether.</p><p>Between this, the <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/i/178108059/18-dissonance-about-dissonance">impossible numbers in the original laboratory study of cognitive dissonance</a>, and a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459231213375">recent failure to replicate a basic dissonance effect</a>, things aren&#8217;t looking great for the phenomenon.<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> But that only makes me believe in it harder!</p><div><hr /></div><h1><strong>(2) THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT AND A LIE FOR THE TRUTH</strong></h1><p>Another classic sadly struck from the canon of behavioral/brain sciences: the neurologist Oliver Sacks appears to have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/oliver-sacks-put-himself-into-his-case-studies-what-was-the-cost">greatly embellished or even invented his case studies</a>. In a letter to his brother, Sacks described his blockbuster <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat </em>as a book of &#8220;fairy tales [...] half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable&#8221;.</p><p>This is exactly how the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/mjhnp_v1">Stanford Prison Experiment</a> and the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957154X221150878">Rosenhan experiment</a> got debunked&#8212;someone started rooting around in the archives and found a bunch of damning notes. I&#8217;m confused: back in the day, why was everybody meticulously documenting their research malfeasance?</p><div><hr /></div><h1><strong>(3) A SMASH HIT</strong></h1><p>If you ever took PSY 101, you&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/S0022-5371(74)80011-3">this study from 1974</a>. You show people a video of a car crash, and then you ask them to estimate how fast the cars were going, and their answer depends on what verb you use. For example, if you ask &#8220;How fast were the cars going when they <em>smashed</em> into each other?&#8221; people give higher speed estimates than if you ask, &#8220;How fast were the cars going when they <em>hit</em> each other?&#8221; (Emphasis mine). This study has been cited nearly <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1177025544043488986&amp;as_sdt=400005&amp;sciodt=0,14&amp;hl=en">4,000 times</a>, and its first author became a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/how-elizabeth-loftus-changed-the-meaning-of-memory">much sought-after expert witness</a> who testifies about the faultiness of memory.</p><p>A blogger named Croissanthology re-ran the study with nearly 10x as many participants (446 vs. 45 in the original). The effect <a href="https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1985941107189166430">did not replicate</a>. No replication is perfect, but no original study is either. And remember, this kind of effect is supposed to be so robust and generalizable that we can deploy it in court.</p><p>I think the underlying point of this research is still correct: memory is reconstructed, not simply recalled, so what we remember is not exactly what we saw. But our memories are not so fragile that a single word can overwrite them. Otherwise, if you ever got pulled over for speeding, you could just be like, &#8220;Officer, how fast was I going when my car <em>crawled past </em>you?&#8221;</p><div><hr /></div><h1><strong>(4) CHOICE UNDERLOAD</strong></h1><p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/386588">one study from 1995</a>, physicians who were shown multiple treatment options were more likely to recommend no treatment at all. The researchers thought this was a &#8220;choice overload&#8221; effect, like &#8220;ahhh there&#8217;s too many choices, so I&#8217;ll just choose nothing at all&#8221;. In contrast, <a href="https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/more-options-more-action-contradicting-a-classic-finding?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">a new study from 2025</a> found that when physicians were shown multiple treatment options, they were somewhat <em>more </em>likely to recommend a treatment.</p><p>I think &#8220;choice overload&#8221; is like many effects we discover in psychology: <em>can </em>it happen? Yes. Can the opposite also happen? Also yes. When does it go one way, and when does it go the other? Ahhh you&#8217;re showing me too many options I don&#8217;t know.</p><div><hr /></div><h1><strong>(5) THE TALE OF THE TWO-INCH DOG</strong></h1><p>Okay, enough dumping on other people&#8217;s research. It&#8217;s my turn in the hot seat.</p><p>In 2022, my colleague Jason Dana and I published a paper showing that <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/youre-probably-wrong-about-how-things">people don&#8217;t know how public opinion has changed</a>.

We come to different conclusions because we ask different questions. Jason and I ask, &#8220;When people estimate change, how <em>far off</em> are they from the right answer?&#8221; Vartanova et al. ask, &#8220;Are people&#8217;s estimates <em>correlated</em> with the right answer?&#8221; These approaches seem like they should give you the same results, but they don&#8217;t, and I&#8217;ll show you why.</p><p>Imagine you ask people to estimate the size of a house, a dog, and a stapler. Vartanova&#8217;s correlation approach would say: &#8220;People know that a house is bigger than a dog, and that a dog is bigger than a stapler. Therefore, people are good at estimating the sizes of things.&#8221; Our approach would say: &#8220;People think a house is three miles long, a dog is two inches, and a stapler is 1.5 centimeters. Therefore, people are <em>not good</em> at estimating the sizes of things.&#8221;</p><p>I think our approach is the right one, for two reasons. First, ours is more useful. As the name implies, a correlation can only tell you about the relationships between things. So it can&#8217;t tell you whether people are good at estimating the size of a house. It can only tell you whether people think houses are <em>bigger than dogs</em>.</p><p>Second, I think our approach is much closer to the way people actually make these judgments in their lives. If I asked you to estimate the size of a house, you wouldn&#8217;t spontaneously be like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s bigger than a dog.&#8221; You&#8217;d just eyeball it. I think people do the same thing with public opinion&#8212;they eyeball it based on headlines they see, conversations they have, and vibes they remember.

Gwern is kind of hard to explain. He&#8217;s famous on some parts of the internet for predicting the &#8220;<a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis">scaling hypothesis</a>&#8221;&#8212;the fact that progress in AI would come from dumping way more data into the models. But he also <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/fiction/poetry/index">writes poetry</a>, does <a href="https://gwern.net/index#qs-sleep">self-experiments</a>, and sustains himself on <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/gwern-branwen">$12,000 a year</a>. He reads 10 hours a day every day, and then occasionally writes for 30 minutes. Here&#8217;s what he said when I was like, &#8220;Very few people do experiments and post them on the internet. Why do <em>you</em> do it?&#8221;</p><blockquote><p>I did it just because it seemed obviously correct and because&#8230; Yeah.

I keep calling to complain about this, but nobody ever does anything about it.</p><div><hr /></div><h1><strong>(12) BE THERE OR BE 11 SQUARES</strong></h1><p><span class="mention-wrap"></span>: </p><blockquote><p>Did you know that this is the most compact known way to pack 11 squares together into a larger square?</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsEp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc38420c4-adfa-4244-b4b9-99c4c5e5a01f_1280x1283.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="474.10859375" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsEp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc38420c4-adfa-4244-b4b9-99c4c5e5a01f_1280x1283.png" width="473" /><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg fill="none" height="20" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>Really makes you think about the mindset of whoever made the universe, am I right?</p></blockquote><p>(More <a href="https://dynomight.substack.com/p/horse">here</a>.)</p><div><hr /></div><h1>(13) NOW WE&#8217;RE COOKING WITH NO GAS</h1><p><span class="mention-wrap"></span> digs up the &#8220;world&#8217;s saddest cookbook&#8221;

Many of those other cognitive dissonance studies have similarly tiny samples, so their existence doesn&#8217;t put me at ease.

The researchers look at that number and go, &#8220;That seems pretty good&#8221;. We look at the exact same number and go, &#8220;That seems pretty bad&#8221;. Obviously this is a judgment call, but getting the direction right is such a low bar that we think it&#8217;s remarkable so many people don&#8217;t clear it. Getting the direction of change wrong is a bit like saying that a dog is bigger than a house.</p></div></div>'}
