{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.filfre.net/feed/', 'value': '<p>Hi, folks&#8230;</p>\n<p>Just a quick note to inform you that the ebook for 1998 is now available <a href="https://www.filfre.net/the-digital-antiquarian-e-book-library/">on the usual page</a>. I&#8217;m sorry this was so long in coming. I owe a huge thanks to my hiking buddy Stefaan Rillaert, who adapted Richard Lindner&#8217;s original scripts to run on Linux instead of Windows.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve elected to make the books available in .epub format only going forward. The .mobi format has been deprecated for some years now, and all but the oldest Kindle e-readers should have received software updates in 2022 to let them handle .epub files natively. If you are stuck with an extremely old Kindle, you can use <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to convert .epub files to .mobi on your computer. I hope this won&#8217;t be too much of an inconvenience.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got the tool chain sorted, new ebooks should be appearing on a more timely basis. Thank you for your patience, and enjoy the 1998 book!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><code> </code><br />\n<strong>Did you enjoy this article?
