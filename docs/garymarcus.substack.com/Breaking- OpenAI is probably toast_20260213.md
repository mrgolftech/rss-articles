I still think so, and I think that moment is drawing close. They have, by any reasonable standard, seen rough times of late. Google and Anthropic have each largely caught up; various Chinese companies are closing in. More and more questions are being raised about their financing. (And more and more people are agreeing that AGI won&#8217;t arrive this decade). </p><p>More than that, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/garymarcus/p/is-the-great-ai-meltdown-imminent?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">last week Nvidia pulled back on a pledge of $100 billion</a>, a terrible signal to other potential investors.</p><p>But you already knew all that. Here&#8217;s the kicker. Up until now, one of the biggest investors in OpenAI has been Masayoshi (Masa) Son &#8212; who was also the biggest investor in WeWork just before it fell &#8211; and this just dropped.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6kFN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63215199-8862-4b4f-9dec-d8ba8678866f_1177x1232.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="1232" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6kFN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63215199-8862-4b4f-9dec-d8ba8678866f_1177x1232.png" width="1177" /><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg fill="none" height="20" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My jaw dropped when I read that.  Ouch. &#8220;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFTBY/earnings/SFTBY-Q3-2026-earnings_call-416286.html">Nothing has been decided</a>&#8221; is hardly a vote of confidence. Especially coupled with the Nvidia walkback of a week earlier. (Though in fairness, the CFO is not Masa Son himself).</p><p>OpenAI is losing money every quarter; even by their own (optimistic) calculations, they won&#8217;t make a profit for years. I doubt their runway would last much more than a year. If the venture capital dries up, they are toast. Talent will make a beeline for competitors. And with Nvidia dropping back and SoftBank potentially following suit, other investors (especially those without skin already in the game) will be skittish, too. They will rightly ask, what do Nvidia and SoftBank know that led them to these choices? As a friend of a friend put it, a lot of additional funding for OpenAI &#8220;is written on wet paper&#8221; that might easily be torn.</p><p>Small wonder OpenAI started probing about bailouts last fall; it&#8217;s looking more and more like they will need one. Hopefully the US government will have the good sense not to bite; Google and Anthropic are doing just fine, without government handouts.  </p><p>OpenAI&#8217;s lead is slipping, and now it looks their financing is, too.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>'}
