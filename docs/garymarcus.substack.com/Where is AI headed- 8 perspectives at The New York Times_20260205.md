Honored to be a part of this, along with Yuval Noah Hariri, [Melanie Mitchell](https://open.substack.com/users/15187849-melanie-mitchell?utm_source=mentions), Helen Toner, [Carl Benedikt Frey](https://open.substack.com/users/2072794-carl-benedikt-frey?utm_source=mentions), [Ajeya Cotra](https://open.substack.com/users/7378131-ajeya-cotra?utm_source=mentions) and co-founders of Perplexity and Cohere:

Naturally, I help anchor the skeptics corner (though I am hardly alone):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0_dR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba142795-3be3-4b22-885e-2d211d298c9b_1170x781.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0_dR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba142795-3be3-4b22-885e-2d211d298c9b_1170x781.jpeg)

And it will be fun to see if Helen Toner is right about this projection for the next five years:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8X5y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5744062f-d6d6-4187-860a-e2e3dc85f574_1346x356.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8X5y!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5744062f-d6d6-4187-860a-e2e3dc85f574_1346x356.png)

All of us expect a big impact on coding:

And I turn out to be on the “large impact” side with respect to education:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KUx8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f48b05a-362f-484d-9eb5-1a340503b3cd_1368x403.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KUx8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f48b05a-362f-484d-9eb5-1a340503b3cd_1368x403.png)

But with some words of caution:

Melanie Mitchell is dead right about this:

I find it interesting seeing non-software people comment on "programming". Of course, the ambiguity between programming proper and taking it as a synonym of software development is part of the problem. Dave Farley and others estimate that "programming proper" only is 10-20% of a software dev's work. Amdahl's Law tells us the rest.

“Unemployment in the United States will have increased significantly as a result of A.I.”

I wonder if you picked true not because of AI itself or because of the AI "bubble"/"capital misallocation" that will certainly bring about a huge correction in the economy
