Once we reach the singularity, If we have the same motivations we have now — primarily power over people — things are going to be horrific” – George Hotz</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is everyone enjoying their singularity? How far is this going to go? Why are we letting the minds that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqH7PPC_J1c">invented fastpass</a> run things? Who are we doing this all for again?</p>\n\n<p>We live in a society. It seems a lot of people have forgotten this. So much stuff that’s being built just shouldn’t be built. You know technology could be good, right? It could all be <a href="https://craigslist.org">like this</a> and <a href="https://shein.com">not like this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is everyone individually too weak to defect? Sounds like we need a revolution.</p>'}
