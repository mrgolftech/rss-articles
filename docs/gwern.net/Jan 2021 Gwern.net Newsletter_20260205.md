January 2021’s [Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2021/01) [newsletter](https://gwern.substack.com) is now out; previous, [December 2020](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/12) ([archives](https://www.gwern.net/tags/newsletter)). This is a summary of the revision-history RSS feed, overlapping with my [Changelog](https://www.gwern.net/Changelog) & /r/gwern; brought to you by my donors on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gwern).

# 2 Links

## 2.1 AI

[Matters Of Scale](https://old.reddit.com/r/mlscaling/):

  * **Scaling up** :

    * [“DALL·E: Creating Images from Text”](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), OpenAI (GPT-3-12.5b generating 1280 tokens → [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00446#deepmind "'Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2', Razavi et al 2019") pixels; generates illustration & photos); [“CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training): Connecting Text and Images”](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), OpenAI ([Radford et al 2021](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision.pdf "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision"): zero-shot image understanding via text description—useful for much more than just ranking DALL·E samples by quality)

Further [blessings of scale](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05#blessings-of-scale): simple [contrastive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05113 "'Contrastive Representation Learning: A Framework and Review', Le-Khac et al 2020") training on _n_ = 400m leads to remarkable generalization & combinatorial flexibility of image generation by DALL·E, and CLIP learns to reach image classification SOTA by zero-shot on many datasets, with more human-like errors & less degradation out of samples than rivals, while costing the same to train. OpenAI released their smallest CLIP model (the “[ViT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy#google "Vision Transformer \(ViT\): An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale")-B/32”-equivalent) and people are discovering it seems able to do just about anything without any further training—the paper notes that it does everything from “fine-grained object classification, geo-localization, action recognition in videos, and OCR”, but there’s so much more, and you can use it to generate image captions/descriptions, classify your anime images, pull a specific target image description by gradient ascent or out of another neural network such as an ImageNet [BigGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096#deepmind "'BigGAN: Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis', Brock et al 2018") or TADNE StyleGAN2-ext (or, why not, synthesize images images embodying abstract concepts like emoji or words like “nightmare fuel” or “confusion”!), search your image datasets by embedding, find mislabeled images (eg by [using “upside down” as the prompt](https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1351191660059832320))… One wonders, like GPT-3, how much better the largest CLIP (“L/14-336px”) is and how many ways of using it (or DALL·E) remain to be found? And why prediction losses work so well in one place, but then contrastive elsewhere?

For perspective: there are newly-minted PhDs going on the job market who got excited about deep learning because of these new [“resnet”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 "'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition', He et al 2015") things; undergrads who applied to grad school because [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805#google "'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding', Devlin et al 2018") et al were blowing open NLP & extending neural supremacy to natural language would not yet have passed quals; and it has been only 1 academic semester since [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165#openai "'GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners', Brown et al 2020") was announced. Or to put it quantitatively, for just sequence modeling: it has been 8,478 days since [LSTM](https://www.gwern.net/docs/ai/1997-hochreiter.pdf "'Long Short-Term Memory', Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997") RNNs were published; 3,045 days since [AlexNet’s](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf "'ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks', Krizhevsky et al 2012") ImageNet scores were released; 1,880 days since residual networks were published in a paper; 1,330 days since [“Attention Is All You Need”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762#google "Vaswani et al 2017") hit Arxiv; 844 days since BERT’s paper was published; 718 days since [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/ "'Better Language Models and Their Implications', OpenAI 2019") was announced; 353 days since [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709#google "'A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations', Chen et al 2020"), and 249 days since GPT-3 was; and 27 days since CLIP/DALL·E.^1^ [Spring is coming.](https://jetpress.org/volume1/moravec.htm "'When will computer hardware match the human brain?', Moravec 1998") (Some still insist we need not worry about “overpopulation on Mars” for >18,264 more days…)

    * [“Meta Pseudo Labels”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10580#google), Pham et al 2020 (90% on ImageNet by pretraining a meta-learning teacher using JFT-300M on a TPUv3-2048)

    * [“Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961#google), Fedus et al 2021 (1.57t-parameter [GShard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668#google "'GShard: Scaling Giant Models with Conditional Computation and Automatic Sharding', Lepikhin et al 2020") followup; the mixture-of-experts approach, while scaling stably, starts showing its limits)

  * **Scaling down** :

    * [“DeiT: Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877#facebook), Touvron et al 2020 (scaling Transformer classifiers down to ImageNet+1-GPU); [“BoTNet: Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11605#google), Srinivas et al 2021/[“Tokens-to-Token ViT: Training Vision Transformers from Scratch on ImageNet”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986), Yuan et al 2021 (hybrids); [“not-so-BigGAN: Generating High-Fidelity Images on Small Compute with Wavelet-based Super-Resolution”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04433), Han et al 2020/[“VQGAN: Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis”](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/), Esser et al 2020 (training >1024px Transformer GANs on just 2 GPUs)

Transformer supremacy in image-related tasks continues, and GANs are becoming increasingly hybridized. Do pure-GANs have a future, now that VAEs and autoregressive models are making such inroads into both the highest-quality & lowest-compute sample generation? To take the GAN/DRL analogy seriously, perhaps they were they ultimately a dead end, akin to trying to learn everything from rewards, and an adversarial GAN loss ought to be only [the cherry on the cake](https://www.gwern.net/images/ai/2019-lecun-isscctalk-cake.png) of a large unsupervised/semi-supervised generative model.

    * [“ZeRO-Offload: Democratizing Billion-Scale Model Training”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06840#microsoft), Ren et al 2021 (partial CPU training for 13b-parameter models on 1 V100 GPU, scaling to 128 GPUs)

    * [“Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00190), Li & Liang 2021 (could the [PET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118 "'It's Not Just Size That Matters: Small Language Models Are Also Few-Shot Learners', Schick & Schütze et al 2020") & CLIP trick of averaging multiple embeddings to yield much better performance be reused for GPT-3 prompts to greatly improve prompting? The fact that the prefix-tuning, by directly optimizing the prompt embeddings, yields better performance than even single optimized text prompts, suggests so. The user could provide 3 or 4 similar prompts, and synthesize them into a single super-prompt to better program GPT-3…)

    * [“Scaling down Deep Learning”](https://greydanus.github.io/2020/12/01/scaling-down/), Greydanus 2020 (cute: parametric simplified-MNIST for rapid iteration on tiny NNs: experiments in lottery-ticket & meta-learning of LRs/activations)
