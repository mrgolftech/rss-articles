<p>Nvidia was only invited to invest. </p>

<p>That is one reversal of commitment. Remember that graph that has been circling around for some time now? The one that shows the circular investment from AI companies:</p>

</p>

<p>Basically Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will then invest $300 billion in Oracle, then Oracle invests back into Nvidia. Now, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, is back tracking and saying he <a href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/02/jensen-huang-nvidia-ceo-on-openai-investment-never-a-commitment/">never made that commitment</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was never a commitment. They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he never committed? Did we make up all these graphs in our head? Was it a misquote from a journalist somewhere that sparkled all this frenzy? Well, you can take a look in <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/">OpenAI press release in September of 2025</a>. They wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, Jensen Huang went on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT. This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like Jensen is distancing himself from that $100 billion commitment. Did he take a peak inside OpenAI and change his mind? At the same time, OpenAI is experimenting with ads. Sam Altman stated before that they would only ever use ads as a last resort. It sounds like we are in the phase. </p>
