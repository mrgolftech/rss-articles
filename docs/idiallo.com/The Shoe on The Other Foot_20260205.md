#  The Shoe on The Other Foot

Ten years ago, I was in a dark season. My first startup had cratered. Confidence, gone. I would walk for hours to clear my head, often through parts of the city we typically hurry past.

One Tuesday, I saw a man sitting outside a boarded-up storefront. He was weathered, his eyes holding a quiet dignity. But I was fixated on a problem to solve. He only had one shoe. The right foot was wrapped in a frayed plastic bag.

I approached, offering to buy him a pair. He smiled, a surprising, warm thing. "Kind of you," he said. "But this one's enough."

I was baffled. Enough? It was objectively not enough. It was a problem to be fixed. I insisted. He listened patiently, then said something that changed my perspective.

"You see a missing shoe. I see a reminder. Every step I take, I feel the world. The cold, the grit, the wet. It keeps me awake. It tells me I'm moving. The day I get too comfortable is the day I stop feeling the road."

I sat with him. I listened. Let's call him David. He spoke not of lack, but of acute awareness. Of a raw, unfiltered connection to his own journey. He was a conscious observer of his circumstance, not a victim.

A gentle rain sprinkled from the sky. He looked up, closed his eyes and embrace every single rain drop. I didn't buy him shoes that day. Instead, I bought us both coffee. We talked for an hour. I told him of my failure. He offered no platitudes, just the quiet acknowledgment that "the road is rough before it smooths."

As I left, a wild, impulsive thought hit me. I took off my own right shoe and left it on the bench. "A trade," I said. "For the perspective."

He laughed, a rich, full sound. I walked back to my empty office in a bespoke suit and one bare foot. The feeling was electric. The vulnerability was terrifying. The concrete was real.

That night, I made two decisions. First, I hired David for a simple, dignified role at the new company I was mustering the courage to build. His insight, his grounded clarity, became a secret weapon in our strategy sessions. He saw through pretense instantly.

Second, I never wore a pair of shoes to work again.

That's right. From that day forward, before I go to a meeting, a negotiation, or any board presentation, I remove my right shoe, place it under my desk and perform my task. The right foot always remain bare.

It is my compass. It grounds me (literally) in the humility of new beginnings. It is a perpetual reminder of the David Principle. True awareness comes from embracing the uncomfortable feel of the road. It forces authenticity. When you negotiate a nine-figure deal with one foot on a cold marble floor, you remember who you are and where you came from.

My team understands. My clients, once startled, now respect it. "There goes the One-Shoe CEO," they say. It's our culture. We don't just solve problems; we _feel_ them.

David has been with the company for a decade now. He's a cherished advisor and friend. We never speak of that first day. The lesson is lived, not referenced.

Why am I sharing this? Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about having the courage to feel the missing piece. To embrace a productive discomfort. To seek wisdom in the most unexpected places and have the conviction to let it alter your path, down to the very shoes you won't wear.

The man with one shoe taught me everything. Because, as it turns out… **I was the shoe on the other foot.**

[ ![Building a Habit for Inaction](https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/554/thumb.jpg) Building a Habit for Inaction ](/blog/building-a-habit-for-inaction?ref=rel)

After walking up a hill and being completely out of breath, I knew it was time for a change. Now, the moment I get home from work, I lace up my running shoes and hit the pavement. After a few weeks, my body started to crave that movement, I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. It became automatic. When you set your bedtime to 10 PM and follow it religiously, as soon as 9:45 hits, your eyelids grow heavy. When lunch is at noon, your stomach starts rumbling at 11:58. That's the result of forming a habit. Repetitive actions carve neural pathways in your brain until they become second nature.

Whenever a major platform announces changes, the internet's response is predictable: "Let's just build our own." I remember the uproar when Facebook introduced Timeline. Users threatened boycotts and vowed to create alternatives. The same pattern emerged with Stack Overflow. There were countless weekend-clone attempts that promised to be "better." Back then, building an alternative felt possible, even if most attempts fizzled out.

Do you have any friends? Not LinkedIn connections, not Instagram followers, not the people you smile at in the office kitchen. I mean _friends_. The kind you can call at 2 a.m. because your world is falling apart. The kind you will sacrifice your own time and money for. I'm asking because that's not what you get when you purchase one of these new AI pendants called "Friend."
