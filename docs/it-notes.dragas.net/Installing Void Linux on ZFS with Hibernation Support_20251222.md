## Introduction

FreeBSD continues to make strides in desktop support, but Linux still holds an advantage in hardware compatibility. After running openSUSE Tumbleweed on my mini PC for several months, I decided it was time to switch to a solution I could control more closely. Not because Tumbleweed doesn't work well - it works great! - but I prefer having direct control over what happens on my machine. And I want native ZFS, because I prefer it over btrfs and it allows me to manage snapshots, backups, and rollbacks just as I do on FreeBSD, using the same tools and procedures.

The choice of [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) comes from its BSD-like approach: modular and free of unnecessary complexity. This makes it an excellent solution for this type of setup.

[ZFSBootMenu](https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/) is an extremely powerful tool. It provides an experience similar to FreeBSD's boot loader and natively supports ZFS. I strongly recommend reading the documentation and exploring its features, as some of them - like the built-in SSH daemon - can be genuine lifesavers in recovery scenarios.

## Prerequisites and Audience

**This guide is not for absolute beginners.** If you're new to Linux or Unix-like operating systems, you'd be better served by a ready-to-use distribution like [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) Leap (or Tumbleweed for a rolling distribution), [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), or [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a stable, upgradeable, and reasonably secure base setup for users already comfortable with system administration. It uses the **glibc** variant of Void Linux. The _[musl](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/musl.html)_ version requires different commands, for example for locale generation.

**Use at your own risk.**

This guide synthesizes instructions from several sources:

  * [Void Linux (UEFI) from ZFSBootMenu](https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/latest/guides/void-linux/uefi.html) \- which doesn't address swap. Using a zvol for swap (not the best solution) prevents hibernation and resume. Our approach uses a separate encrypted swap partition that enables proper resume.
  * [Void Linux Full Disk Encryption](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/fde.html) \- excellent for btrfs or ext4, but we want ZFS. We'll borrow the swap configuration approach from here.
  * [Install Void Linux with a desktop environment + Flatpaks](https://compactbunker.org/p/install-void-linux/) \- for the desktop portion.



If your setup differs from what's described here (NVMe disk, UEFI boot, Secure Boot disabled), consult the linked guides for explanations and variations.

### Installation Script (Optional)

If you want to reproduce this setup quickly, I maintain a script that automates the procedure described in this guide: disk partitioning, ZFS pool and dataset creation, encrypted swap for hibernation resume, dracut configuration, and ZFSBootMenu EFI setup. An optional KDE Plasma desktop installation is also supported.

The script is interactive and will ask for the required parameters (target disk, timezone and keymap, passphrases, desktop options). [Requirements, usage instructions, and known limitations are documented in the repository README](https://brew.bsd.cafe/stefano/void-zfs-hibernation)

That said, I still recommend going through the manual process at least once. Understanding each step is part of the value of this setup, especially when troubleshooting or adapting it to different hardware.

## Boot Environment

Since ZFS isn't supported by the base Void Linux image, we'll use [hrmpf](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/hrmpf/releases), an excellent rescue system based on Void Linux that includes ZFS support out of the box.

After booting, you can either proceed directly or SSH into the machine to continue remotely. I generally prefer SSH since it makes copy-paste operations much easier - especially when dealing with UUIDs and long commands. To enable SSH access, set a root password and allow root login:
    
    
    passwd
    

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and enable:
    
    
    PermitRootLogin yes
    

Restart the SSH daemon:
    
    
    sv restart sshd
    

Find the machine's IP address:
    
    
    ip addr
    

You can now connect via SSH from another device.

## Initial Setup

Set up the environment variables and generate a host ID - we need it for ZFS:
    
    
    source /etc/os-release
    export ID
    
    zgenhostid -f 0x00bab10c
    

## Disk Configuration

Identify your target disk and set up the partition variables. This approach keeps everything consistent and reduces errors:
    
    
    # Set the base disk - adjust this to match your system
    export DISK="/dev/nvme0n1"
    
    # For NVMe disks, partitions are named like nvme0n1p1, nvme0n1p2, etc.
    # For SATA/SAS disks (sda, sdb), partitions are named sda1, sda2, etc.
    # Set the partition separator accordingly:
    export PART_SEP="p"  # Use "p" for NVMe, empty string "" for SATA/SAS
    
    # Define partition numbers
    export BOOT_PART="1"
    export SWAP_PART="2"
    export POOL_PART="3"
    
    # Build full device paths
    export BOOT_DEVICE="${DISK}${PART_SEP}${BOOT_PART}"
    export SWAP_DEVICE="${DISK}${PART_SEP}${SWAP_PART}"
    export POOL_DEVICE="${DISK}${PART_SEP}${POOL_PART}"
    

Verify your configuration before proceeding:
    
    
    echo "Boot device: $BOOT_DEVICE"
    echo "Swap device: $SWAP_DEVICE"
    echo "Pool device: $POOL_DEVICE"
    

## Wipe the Disk

**Warning: This operation will irreversibly destroy all data on the selected disk. Double-check that you've selected the correct disk and be sure to have a complete backup of your system!**
    
    
    zpool labelclear -f "$DISK"
    
    wipefs -a "$DISK"
    sgdisk --zap-all "$DISK"
    

## Create Partitions

### EFI System Partition

If you're not using UEFI boot, adapt this procedure following the appropriate guide linked at the beginning of this post:
    
    
    sgdisk -n "${BOOT_PART}:1m:+512m" -t "${BOOT_PART}:ef00" "$DISK"
    

### Swap Partition

The swap partition should be slightly larger than your RAM to support hibernation. When you hibernate, the entire contents of RAM are written to swap, so you need enough space to hold it all plus some overhead. In this example, I have 16 GB of RAM, so I'm creating an 18 GB swap partition:
    
    
    sgdisk -n "${SWAP_PART}:0:+18g" -t "${SWAP_PART}:8200" "$DISK"
    

### ZFS Pool Partition
    
    
    sgdisk -n "${POOL_PART}:0:-10m" -t "${POOL_PART}:bf00" "$DISK"
    

## Set Up ZFS Encryption

Encrypting the disk is strongly recommended, especially for laptops. Replace `SomeKeyphrase` with a strong passphrase that's easy to type. Keep in mind that during early boot, the keyboard layout might default to US, so choose a passphrase that's easy to type on a US keyboard layout:
    
    
    echo 'SomeKeyphrase' > /etc/zfs/zroot.key
    chmod 000 /etc/zfs/zroot.key
    

## Create the ZFS Pool

Create the pool with conservative, well-tested options:
    
    
    zpool create -f -o ashift=12 \
     -O compression=lz4 \
     -O acltype=posixacl \
     -O xattr=sa \
     -O relatime=on \
     -O encryption=aes-256-gcm \
     -O keylocation=file:///etc/zfs/zroot.key \
     -O keyformat=passphrase \
     -o autotrim=on \
     -o compatibility=openzfs-2.2-linux \
     -m none zroot "$POOL_DEVICE"
    

## Create ZFS Datasets
    
    
    zfs create -o mountpoint=none zroot/ROOT
    zfs create -o mountpoint=/ -o canmount=noauto zroot/ROOT/${ID}
    zfs create -o mountpoint=/home zroot/home
    
    zpool set bootfs=zroot/ROOT/${ID} zroot
    

## Export and Reimport for Installation
    
    
    zpool export zroot
    zpool import -N -R /mnt zroot
    zfs load-key -L prompt zroot
    
    zfs mount zroot/ROOT/${ID}
    zfs mount zroot/home
    
    udevadm trigger
    

## Install the Base System
    
    
    XBPS_ARCH=x86_64 xbps-install \
      -S -R https://mirrors.servercentral.com/voidlinux/current \
      -r /mnt base-system
    

## Copy Host Configuration

Copy the files we generated earlier to the new system:
    
    
    cp /etc/hostid /mnt/etc
    mkdir -p /mnt/etc/zfs
    cp /etc/zfs/zroot.key /mnt/etc/zfs
    

## Configure Encrypted Swap

Now we'll set up the encrypted swap partition. This is where the hibernation magic happens - by using a separate LUKS-encrypted partition instead of a ZFS zvol, we can properly resume from hibernation.

Format the swap partition with LUKS:
    
    
    cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks1 "$SWAP_DEVICE"
    

Open the encrypted partition, create the swap filesystem, and activate it:
    
    
    cryptsetup luksOpen "$SWAP_DEVICE" cryptswap
    mkswap /dev/mapper/cryptswap
    swapon /dev/mapper/cryptswap
    

## Preserve Variables for Chroot

Before entering the chroot, save the disk variables so they remain available inside the new environment:
    
    
    cat << EOF > /mnt/root/disk-vars.sh
    export DISK="$DISK"
    export PART_SEP="$PART_SEP"
    export BOOT_PART="$BOOT_PART"
    export SWAP_PART="$SWAP_PART"
    export POOL_PART="$POOL_PART"
    export BOOT_DEVICE="$BOOT_DEVICE"
    export SWAP_DEVICE="$SWAP_DEVICE"
    export POOL_DEVICE="$POOL_DEVICE"
    export ID="$ID"
    EOF
    

## Enter the Chroot Environment
    
    
    xchroot /mnt
    

From this point forward, all commands are executed inside the new system.

First, load the saved variables:
    
    
    source /root/disk-vars.sh
    

## Configure fstab

Add the swap entry to `/etc/fstab`:
    
    
    /dev/mapper/cryptswap   none            swap            defaults        0 0
    

## Set Up Automatic Swap Unlock

To avoid entering the swap password separately after unlocking the ZFS pool, we'll create a keyfile stored on the encrypted ZFS dataset. This is secure because the keyfile only becomes accessible after the ZFS pool is unlocked.

First, install cryptsetup in the new system:
    
    
    xbps-install -S cryptsetup
    

Generate a random keyfile and add it to the LUKS partition:
    
    
    dd bs=1 count=64 if=/dev/urandom of=/boot/volume.key
    
    cryptsetup luksAddKey "$SWAP_DEVICE" /boot/volume.key
    
    chmod 000 /boot/volume.key
    chmod -R g-rwx,o-rwx /boot
    

Add the keyfile to `/etc/crypttab`:
    
    
    echo "cryptswap   $SWAP_DEVICE   /boot/volume.key   luks" >> /etc/crypttab
    

Include the keyfile and crypttab in the initramfs. Create `/etc/dracut.conf.d/10-crypt.conf`:
    
    
    install_items+=" /boot/volume.key /etc/crypttab "
    

## Basic System Configuration

Configure keyboard layout and hardware clock. Adjust the keymap and timezone to match your location:
    
    
    cat << EOF >> /etc/rc.conf
    KEYMAP="us"
    HARDWARECLOCK="UTC"
    EOF
    
    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Rome /etc/localtime
    

Configure locales:
    
    
    cat << EOF >> /etc/default/libc-locales
    en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
    en_US ISO-8859-1
    EOF
    
    echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
    
    xbps-reconfigure -f glibc-locales
    

Set the root password:
    
    
    passwd
    

## Configure ZFS Boot Support
    
    
    cat << EOF > /etc/dracut.conf.d/zol.conf
    nofsck="yes"
    add_dracutmodules+=" zfs "
    omit_dracutmodules+=" btrfs "
    install_items+=" /etc/zfs/zroot.key "
    EOF
    

Install ZFS:
    
    
    xbps-install -S zfs
    

## Configure ZFSBootMenu

Set the basic boot properties:
    
    
    zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:commandline="quiet" zroot/ROOT
    zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:keysource="zroot/ROOT/${ID}" zroot
    

### The Critical Step: Hibernation Support

Now we need to configure hibernation resume. This is the key insight that makes this setup work: normally, the encrypted ZFS root mounts first, and then it unlocks the swap partition. But when resuming from hibernation, the kernel needs to read the hibernation image from swap _before_ mounting the root filesystem - otherwise, the saved state would be lost.

To solve this, we tell ZFSBootMenu to unlock the swap partition early, before mounting ZFS, by specifying its LUKS UUID.

Get the UUID of your swap partition:
    
    
    blkid "$SWAP_DEVICE"
    

You'll see output like:
    
    
    /dev/...: UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTUUID="..."
    

Store the UUID in a variable for the next step:
    
    
    SWAP_UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value "$SWAP_DEVICE")
    echo "Swap UUID: $SWAP_UUID"
    

Now set the boot parameters using the captured UUID:
    
    
    zfs set org.zfsbootmenu:commandline="rd.luks.uuid=$SWAP_UUID resume=/dev/mapper/cryptswap" zroot/ROOT/${ID}
    

## Set Up EFI Boot

Create and mount the EFI partition:
    
    
    mkfs.vfat -F32 "$BOOT_DEVICE"
    
    mkdir -p /boot/efi
    

Add the EFI partition to `/etc/fstab` using its UUID:
    
    
    BOOT_UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value "$BOOT_DEVICE")
    echo "UUID=$BOOT_UUID    /boot/efi    vfat    defaults    0 0" >> /etc/fstab
    

Mount it:
    
    
    mount /boot/efi
    

## Install ZFSBootMenu
    
    
    xbps-install -S curl
    
    mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/ZBM
    curl -o /boot/efi/EFI/ZBM/VMLINUZ.EFI -L https://get.zfsbootmenu.org/efi
    cp /boot/efi/EFI/ZBM/VMLINUZ.EFI /boot/efi/EFI/ZBM/VMLINUZ-BACKUP.EFI
    

Configure the EFI boot entries:
    
    
    xbps-install -S efibootmgr
    
    efibootmgr -c -d "$DISK" -p "$BOOT_PART" \
      -L "ZFSBootMenu (Backup)" \
      -l '\EFI\ZBM\VMLINUZ-BACKUP.EFI'
    
    efibootmgr -c -d "$DISK" -p "$BOOT_PART" \
      -L "ZFSBootMenu" \
      -l '\EFI\ZBM\VMLINUZ.EFI'
    

### Microcode updates

Void Linux is modular, so you may need to install additional packages for your specific hardware. For the Intel microcode, you need the non-free repo: For example:
    
    
    # For Intel CPUs
    xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree 
    xbps-install -S intel-ucode
    
    # For AMD CPUs/GPUs
    xbps-install -S linux-firmware-amd
    

After installing microcode updates, regenerate the boot images and exit:
    
    
    xbps-reconfigure -fa
    

## Desktop Installation (Optional)

If all you need is a minimal system or a server, you're done and ready to reboot. For a complete desktop environment, continue with the following steps.

### Install Core Desktop Packages
    
    
    xbps-install -S vim nano dbus elogind polkit xorg xorg-fonts xorg-video-drivers xorg-input-drivers dejavu-fonts-ttf terminus-font NetworkManager pipewire alsa-pipewire wireplumber xdg-user-dirs unzip gzip xz 7zip
    

### Install KDE Plasma
    
    
    xbps-install -S kde-plasma dolphin konsole firefox kdegraphics-thumbnailers ffmpegthumbs vlc ark kwrite discover kf6-purpose
    

### Enable Services
    
    
    ln -s /etc/sv/NetworkManager /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
    ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
    ln -s /etc/sv/udevd /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
    ln -s /etc/sv/polkitd /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
    ln -s /etc/sv/sddm /etc/runit/runsvdir/default/
    

### Configure PipeWire Audio
    
    
    mkdir -p /etc/xdg/autostart
    ln -sf /usr/share/applications/pipewire.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/
    
    mkdir -p /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
    ln -sf /usr/share/examples/wireplumber/10-wireplumber.conf /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
    ln -sf /usr/share/examples/pipewire/20-pipewire-pulse.conf /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
    
    mkdir -p /etc/alsa/conf.d
    ln -sf /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/50-pipewire.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
    ln -sf /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
    

### Enable Additional Repositories and Flatpak (Optional)
    
    
    xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree void-repo-multilib void-repo-multilib-nonfree
    
    xbps-install -S flatpak
    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    

### Create a Regular User and exit

For desktop use, create a non-root user with appropriate group memberships. Replace `username` with your desired username.
    
    
    useradd -m username
    passwd username
    usermod username -G video,wheel,plugdev,kvm,audio,network
    exit
    

### Fix for NetworkManager

xchroot will bind mount /etc/resolv.conf and leave an empty file. Network Manager won't like it. So let's clean it up:
    
    
    umount -l /mnt/etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null || true
    
    rm -f /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
    ln -s /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
    

## Exit and Reboot
    
    
    umount -n -R /mnt
    zpool export zroot
    reboot
    

## Post-Installation

If everything went well, after entering your ZFS encryption password, you'll be greeted by the SDDM login screen.

## Testing Hibernation

To verify that hibernation works correctly, you can clock the "Hibernate" button or:
    
    
    loginctl hibernate
    

The system should power off. When you turn it back on, ZFSBootMenu will prompt for the password, unlock the swap partition, detect the hibernation image, and resume your session exactly where you left off.

If resume fails, check that: 1. The LUKS UUID in the ZFS commandline property matches your swap partition 2. The swap partition is large enough for your RAM 3. The dracut configuration includes the crypttab and keyfile

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional Void Linux system with native ZFS, full disk encryption, and working hibernation. The system is rolling, lightweight, and easy to maintain. Enjoy!
