At the time you could still do the trick\nwhere you load up on Xbox Live Gold and then convert it to Game Pass Ultimate\ncheaply.</p>\n\n<p>I signed up for it and then <strong>made absolutely sure to disable any autorenewing settings everywhere I could.</strong> I remember  seeing something to the effect of “Your subscription will\nexpire 2/2026 and will not renew.</p>\n\n<p>At the time I still trusted Microsoft a little, but I made sure to use a one\ntime use credit card number, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>Lo and behold, I just got this email:</p>\n\n<p><img alt="there is only one ad and one video visible" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2026-02-14-microsoft-game-pass-fraud/those_liars_and_cheats.png" /></p>\n\n<p>Conveniently for those liars and cheats at Microsoft, <em>somehow</em> in the intervening\nthree years autorenew got turned back on. Oopsie whoopsie sowwy 👉👈!</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know how this isn’t outright fraud.</p>'}
