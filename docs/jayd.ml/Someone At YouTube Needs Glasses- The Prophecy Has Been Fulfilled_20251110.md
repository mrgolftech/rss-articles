# Someone At YouTube Needs Glasses: The Prophecy Has Been Fulfilled

Nov 10, 2025 

In my [recent analysis of YouTube’s information density ](/2025/04/30/someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses.html) I included the results from an advanced statistical analysis on the number of videos present on the home page, which projected that around May 2026 there would only be one lonely video on the home screen.

Amazingly, a disgruntled Googler [leaked a recording of how YouTube’s PM org handled the criticism](https://youtu.be/_tZckjQylGU?t=25) as it sat at the [top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43846487) for a whole day for some reason.

The net result is that after months of hard work by ~~Gemini~~ YouTube engineers, the other day I fired up YouTube on an Apple TV and was graced with this:

Let’s analyze this picture and count the number of videos on the home screen:

Unfortunately the YouTube PM org’s myopia is accelerating: with this data I now project that there will be zero videos on the homescreen around May of 2026 now, up from September.

Apparently [Poe’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) applies to Google PMs, satire is dead, and maybe our mandatory NeuraLinks are coming sooner than I thought.
