<p>Over the weekend Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">retracted an article</a> because the AI a writer used <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p">hallucinated quotes</a> from an open source library maintainer.</p>
<p>The irony here is the maintainer in question, Scott Shambaugh, was <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">harassed by someone's AI agent</a> over not merging its AI slop code.</p>
<p>It's likely the bot was running through someone's local 'agentic AI' instance (likely using OpenClaw). The guy who built OpenClaw was just hired by OpenAI to &quot;work on bringing agents to everyone.&quot; You'll have to forgive me if I'm not enthusastic about that.</p>
