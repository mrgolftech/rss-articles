<p>In October, my Dad and I got to go behind the scenes at two St. Louis Blues (NHL hockey) games, and observe the massive team effort involved in putting together a modern digital sports broadcast.</p>

<p>I wanted to explore the timing and digital side of a modern <a href="https://www.smpte.org/standards/st2110">SMPTE 2110</a> mobile unit, and my Dad has been involved in studio and live broadcast for decades, so he enjoyed the experience as the engineer <em>not</em> on duty!</p>
