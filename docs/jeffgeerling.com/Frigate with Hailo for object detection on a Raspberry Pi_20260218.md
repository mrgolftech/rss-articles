<p>I run <a href="https://frigate.video">Frigate</a> to record security cameras and detect people, cars, and animals when in view. My <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-pi-frigate-nvr-axzezs-interceptor-1u-case/">current Frigate server</a> runs on a Raspberry Pi CM4 and a <a href="https://amzn.to/4aWdOpQ">Coral TPU</a> plugged in via USB.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi offers <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat/">multiple AI HAT+'s</a> for the Raspberry Pi 5 with built-in Hailo-8 or Hailo-8L AI coprocessors, and they're useful for low-power inference (like for image object detection) on the Pi. Hailo coprocessors can be used with other SBCs and computers too, if you buy an <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/hailo-8.htm">M.2 version</a>.</p>
