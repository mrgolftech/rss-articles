<p>Apparently Apple thinks nobody with a modern Mac uses spinning rust (hard drives with platters) anymore.</p>
<p>I plugged in a hard drive from an old iMac into my Mac Studio using my <a href="https://amzn.to/4aP7e3d">Sabrent USB to SATA Hard Drive</a> enclosure, and opened up Disk Utility, clicked on the top-level disk in the sidebar, and clicked 'Erase'.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, there's no 'Security Options' button on there, as there had been since—I believe—the very first version of Disk Utility in Mac OS X!</p>
