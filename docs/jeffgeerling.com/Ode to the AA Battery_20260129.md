<p>Recently <a href="https://x.com/Merocle/status/2015496917472489751">this post from @Merocle</a> caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm fixing my iFixit soldering station. I haven't used it for a long time and the battery has gone overdischarge. I hope it will come back to life. Unfortunately, there are no replacements available for sale at the moment.</p>

<p>Devices with built-in rechargeable batteries have been bugging me a lot lately. It's convenient to have a device you can take with you and use anywhere. And with modern Li-ion cells, battery life is remarkable.</p>
