<p>When I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acBv3G8r-1Y">Jensen Huang introduce the Reachy Mini at CES</a>, I thought it was a gimmick. His keynote showed this little robot responding to human input, turning its head to look at a TODO list on the wall, sending emails, and turning drawings into architectural renderings with motion.</p>

<p>HuggingFace and Pollen robotics sent me a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/Reachy_Mini">Reachy Mini</a> to test, and, well, at least if you're looking to replicate that setup in the keynote, it's not, as Jensen put it, &quot;utterly trivial now.&quot;</p>
