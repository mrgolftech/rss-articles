<p>Ever since the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5/">Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5</a> was introduced, I wondered why nobody built a decent laptop chassis around it.</p>

<p>You could swap out a low spec CM5 for a higher spec, and get an instant computer upgrade. Or, assuming a CM6 comes out someday in the same form factor, the laptop chassis could get an entirely new life with that upgrade.</p>
