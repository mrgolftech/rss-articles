It&apos;s an org chart with robots instead of interns. The VP of Engineering becomes the VP of Engineering Agents.</p><p>Congratulations. You&apos;ve reinvented middle management.</p><p>This is what Clayton Christensen would have called a sustaining innovation in the guise of disruption: you&apos;re using new technology to do the same thing slightly more efficiently, in a way that looks and feels like the old thing, and the incumbents love it because the power structure stays intact.</p><p>The person at the top still delegates. They still think in terms of roles and departments and functional areas. They&apos;ve just swapped out the people underneath them for software that doesn&apos;t need health insurance.</p><p>But when an actually disruptive technology arrives, it makes the existing structure irrelevant. </p><p>And AI is that tech.</p><h2 id="roles-are-an-artifact-not-a-law">Roles are an artifact, not a law</h2><p>The entire &quot;swarms of agents&quot; model is based on the idea that work naturally decomposes into roles. You ~need a marketing agent, a sales agent, a support agent, a development agent - because marketing, sales, support, and development are existing job titles and, for humans at least, fundamentally different activities that belong in different boxes.</p><p>This feels like an obvious truism, but it&apos;s a depreciable artifact of organizational scaling, not some deep // universal truth about work itself.</p><p>Adam Smith&apos;s pin factory example is famous because he showed that dividing labor into specialized roles made pin production dramatically more efficient. But the pin factory was a specific solution to a specific constraint: individual humans are slow, they get tired, and they can only hold so much context in their heads at once.</p><p>Specialization was a workaround for bio-cognition. If you could have one person who simultaneously understood metallurgy, wire-drawing, straightening, cutting, pointing, grinding, and packaging - and could do all of it concurrently without fatigue - Smith would never have divided the labor in the first place.</p><p>That hypothetical person is what a solo practitioner with a capable AI already looks like.</p><h2 id="outcomes-over-org-charts">Outcomes over org charts</h2><p>When I sit down with an AI assistant and say &quot;write me a marketing brief, then generate the landing page copy, then draft the ad variants, then build the page, then set up the analytics tracking,&quot; I&apos;m not managing a team of five agents with five different specializations. I&apos;m issuing a sequence of commands to the same system from the same interface.</p><p>The boundaries between &quot;marketer&quot; and &quot;developer&quot; and &quot;analyst&quot; dissolve, because those boundaries were never real boundaries in the work itself. They were boundaries in human capacity.</p><p>The people who will thrive aren&apos;t &quot;agent managers.&quot; They&apos;re people who can say what they want and evaluate whether they got it - and whether what they got was either good or shit.</p><p>The workflow looks less like a CEO directing department heads and more like a musician working in a DAW: one person playing every instrument, mixing, mastering, and producing, toggling between tasks at the speed of thought rather than delegating through layers of abstraction.</p><p>Brian Eno talked about the recording studio as a compositional tool &#x2014; something that collapsed composer, performer, and engineer into one creative role. AI is doing the same thing to knowledge work, collapsing strategist, executor, and analyst into one operational role.</p><h2 id="this-is-already-happening">This is ~already happening</h2><p>Plenty of one-person businesses are shipping products, running marketing, handling support, and managing finances through a single AI-augmented workflow. They&apos;re not thinking about it in terms of agents with job titles. They&apos;re thinking about it as &quot;what do I need to get done today&quot; and then doing all of it, fluidly, without ever switching between conceptual departments.</p><p>The &quot;swarm of agents&quot; idea appeals to people who either come from or aspire to the world of management. If you&apos;ve spent your career hiring people and organizing them into teams - or dreaming // LARPing about becoming a CEO - then naturally you look at AI and see a new kind of team to organize. It&apos;s Maslow&apos;s hammer. When all you have is an org chart, everything looks like a headcount decision.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2><p>If you believe the future is agent management, you&apos;ll build tools for orchestrating fleets of specialized bots. You&apos;ll create dashboards for monitoring your marketing agent separately from your sales agent separately from your dev agent. You&apos;ll recreate Salesforce, but for robots.</p><p>If you believe the future is unified execution, you&apos;ll build tools that let one person express intent and get outcomes across every domain from a single surface. The interface collapses. The abstraction layers disappear. You don&apos;t manage agents any more than you manage the individual transistors in your laptop.</p><p>The first path leads to a world that looks a lot like the one we already have, just with fewer humans in the lower tiers.</p><p>The second path leads to something actually new: a world where the unit of economic production isn&apos;t the company or the team but the individual, with a general-purpose cognitive tool that makes specialization itself an anachronism.</p><p>I know which version the people who currently sit atop org charts would prefer. And I know which version the technology is actually pushing toward. Those two things, for the moment, are very different.</p><p>But the technology tends to win these arguments eventually. It won in music production. It won in publishing. It won in video. Every time a tool collapses specialized roles into generalist capability, the generalists inherit the earth &#x2014; no matter how loudly the specialists insist their particular expertise can&apos;t be automated or absorbed.</p><p>The future of work isn&apos;t managing a swarm.</p><p>It&apos;s being the swarm.</p>'}
