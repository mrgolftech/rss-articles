But what is the minimum value of\xa0<em>f</em>?</p>\n<p>The <strong>Chowla cosine conjecture</strong> says that the minimum should be less than −√<em>n</em> for large <em>n</em>. For now the best proven results are much smaller in absolute value [1].</p>\n<p>I was playing around with this problem, and the first thing I thought of was to let the set\xa0<em>A</em> be the first\xa0<em>n</em> primes. This turned out to not be the most interesting example. Since all the primes except for the first are odd, and cos(<em>k</em>π) = −1 for odd\xa0<em>k</em>, the minimum was always approximately −<em>n</em> and always occurred near π [2].</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a plot where\xa0<em>A</em> is the set of primes less than 100.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="360" src="https://www.johndcook.com/chowla_prime.png" width="480" /></p>\n<p>For the cosine conjecture to be interesting, the set\xa0<em>A</em> should contain a mix of even and odd numbers.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a plot with <em>A</em> equal to a random selection of 25 points between 1 and 100. (I chose 25 because there are 25 primes less than 100.)</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="360" src="https://www.johndcook.com/chowla_random.png" width="480" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the Python code I used to generate the two sets\xa0<em>A</em> and the function to plot.</p>\n<pre>import numpy as np\nfrom sympy import prime\n\ndef f(x, A):\n    return sum([np.cos(k*x) for k in A])\n\nn = 25\nA_prime = [prime(i) for i in range(1, n+1)]\nnp.random.seed(20260207)\nA_random = np.random.choice(range(1, 101), size=n, replace=False)\n</pre>\n<p>If you wanted to explore the Chowla conjecture numerically, direct use of minimization software is impractical. As you can tell from the plots above, there are a lot of local minima. If the values in <em>A</em> are not too large, you can look at a plot to see approximately where the minimum occurs, then use a numerical method to find the minimum in this region, but that doesn&#8217;t scale.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an approach that would scale better. You could find all the zeros of the derivative of <em>f</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> and evaluate the function at each. One of these is the minimum. The derivative is a sum of sines with integer frequencies, and so it could be written as a polynomial in <em>z</em> = exp(<em>ix</em>) [3]. You could find all the zeros of this polynomial using the QR algorithm as discussed in the <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/06/eigenvalue-roots/">previous post</a>.</p>\n<p>[1] Benjamin Bedert. Polynomial bounds for the Chowla cosine problem. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05260v2">arXiv</a></p>\n<p>[2] If\xa0<em>A</em> is the set of the first\xa0<em>n</em> primes,\xa0<em>f</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>(π) = 2 −\xa0<em>n</em> because the sum defining <em>f</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>(π) has one term equal to 1 and <em>n</em> − 1 terms equal to −1. I think for\xa0<em>n</em> ≥ 4 this is the minimum, but I haven&#8217;t verified this. If so, the minimum isn&#8217;t just near π but exactly at π.</p>\n<p>[3] You get a polynomial of degree <em>n</em> in <em>z</em> and 1/<em>z</em>. Then multiply by <em>z</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> to get a polynomial in <em>z</em> only of degree 2<em>n</em>.</p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/07/chowla/">Minimum of cosine sum</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
