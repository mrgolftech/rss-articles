# Polish serenity

Posted on [3 February 2026](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/03/polish-serenity/ "06:56") by [John](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/author/john/ "View all posts by John")

Yesterday I ran across the following mashup by [Amy Swearer](https://x.com/AmySwearer/status/2018363836336607464) of a Polish proverb and the Serenity Prayer.

> Lord, grant me the serenity to accept when it's no longer my circus,  
>  the courage to control the monkeys that are still mine,  
>  and the wisdom to know the difference.

The proverb is "Nie mój cyrk, nie moje małpy," literally "Not my circus, not my monkeys".
