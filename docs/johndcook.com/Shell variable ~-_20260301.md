{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.johndcook.com/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>After writing the <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/28/file-extensions-bash/">previous post</a>, I poked around in the bash shell documentation and found a handy feature I&#8217;d never seen before, the shortcut <code>~-</code>.</p>\n<p>I frequently use the command <code>cd -</code> to return to the previous working directory, but didn&#8217;t know about <code>~-</code> as a shotrcut for the shell variable <code>$OLDPWD</code> which contains the name of the previous working directory.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I will be using this feature now that I know about it. Fairly often I work in two directories, and moving back and forth between them using <code>cd -</code>, and need to compare files in the two locations. If I have files in both directories with the same name, say <code>notes.org</code>, I can diff them by running</p>\n<pre>    diff notes.org ~-/notes.org</pre>\n<p>I was curious why I&#8217;d never run into <code>~-</code> before. Maybe it&#8217;s a relatively recent bash feature? No, it&#8217;s been there since bash was released in 1989. The feature was part of C shell before that, though not part of Bourne shell. </p>\n<p>I learned the basics of the command line before bash came out. I&#8217;ve picked up newer features here and there by osmosis, but I&#8217;ve never read the bash manual systematically. Maybe I should. No doubt I&#8217;d learn some useful tricks if I did. </p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/03/01/tilde-dash/">Shell variable ~-</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
