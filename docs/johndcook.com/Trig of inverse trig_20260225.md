{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.johndcook.com/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>I ran across an old article [1] that gave a sort of multiplication table for trig functions and inverse trig functions. Here&#8217;s my version of the table.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="1219" src="https://www.johndcook.com/trig_of_inverse4.svg" width="336" /></p>\n<p>I made a few changes from the original. First, I used LaTeX, which didn&#8217;t exist when the article was written in 1957. Second, I only include sin, cos, and tan; the original also included csc, sec, and cot. Third, I reversed the labels of the rows and columns. Each cell represents a trig function applied to an inverse trig function.</p>\n<p>The third point requires a little elaboration. The table represents function composition, not multiplication, but is expressed in the format of a multiplication table. For the composition <em>f</em>(\xa0<em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) ), do you expect\xa0<em>f</em> to be on the side or top? It wouldn&#8217;t matter if the functions commuted under composition, but they don&#8217;t. I think it feels more conventional to put the outer function on the side; the author make the opposite choice.</p>\n<p>The identities in the table are all easy to prove, so the results aren&#8217;t interesting so much as the arrangement. I&#8217;d never seen these identities arranged into a table before. The matrix of identities is not symmetric, but the 2 by 2 matrix in the upper left corner is because</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 40px;">sin(cos<sup>−1</sup>(<em>x</em>)) = cos(sin<sup>−1</sup>(<em>x</em>)).</p>\n<p>The entries of the third row and third column are not symmetric, though they do have some similarities.</p>\n<p>You can prove the identities in the sin, cos, and tan rows by focusing on the angles θ, φ, and ψ below respectively because θ = sin<sup>−1</sup>(<em>x</em>), φ = cos<sup>−1</sup>(<em>x</em>), and ψ = tan<sup>−1</sup>(<em>x</em>). This shows that the square roots in the table above all fall out of the Pythagorean theorem.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="241" src="https://www.johndcook.com/sin_arcsin.png" width="291" /></p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="234" src="https://www.johndcook.com/tan_arctan2.png" width="289" /></p>\n<p>[1] G.
