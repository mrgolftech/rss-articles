That&#8217;s a common term in jazz. In classical music you&#8217;d likely say augmented fourth or diminished fifth. Same thing.</p>\n<p>The largest possible movement in roots corresponds to almost the smallest possible movement between chords. Specifically, to go from a dominant seventh chord to another dominant seventh chord whose roots are a tritone apart only requires moving two notes of the chord a half step each.</p>\n<p>For example, C and F♯ are a tritone apart, but a C<sup>7</sup> chord and a F♯<sup>7</sup> chord are very close together. To move from the former to the latter you only need to move two notes a half step.</p>\n<p><img alt="Musical clock" class="aligncenter size-medium" height="300" src="https://www.johndcook.com/CFsharp.png" width="700" /></p>\n<p>Replacing a dominant seventh chord with one a tritone away is called a <strong>tritone substitution</strong>, or just <strong>tritone sub</strong>. It&#8217;s called this for two reasons. The root moves a tritone, but also the tritone\xa0<em>inside</em> the chord does\xa0<em>not</em> move. In the example above, the third and the seventh of the C<sup>7</sup> chord become the seventh and third of the F♯<sup>7</sup> chord. On the diagram, the dots at 4:00 and 10:00 don&#8217;t move.</p>\n<p>Tritone substitutions are a common technique for making basic chord progressions more sophisticated. A common tritone sub is to replace the V of a ii-V-I chord progression, giving a nice chromatic progression in the bass line. For example, in the key of C, a D min &#8211; G<sup>7</sup>&#8211; C progression becomes D min &#8211; D♭<sup>7</sup>\xa0&#8211; C.</p>\n<h2>Related posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/09/30/perfect-fifths-equal-temperament/">Circle of fifths and roots of two</a></li>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/02/07/structure-in-jazz-and-math/">Structure in jazz and math</a></li>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/03/16/grokking-james-bond/">The James Bond chord</a></li>\n</ul>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/23/tritone-sub/">Tritone substitution</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
