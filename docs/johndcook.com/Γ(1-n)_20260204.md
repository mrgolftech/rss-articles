# Γ(1/n)

Posted on [4 February 2026](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/04/gamma-reciprocal/ "21:42") by [John](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/author/john/ "View all posts by John")

If _n_ is a positive integer, then rounding Γ(1/_n_) up to the nearest integer gives  _n_. In symbols,

![\\left\\lceil \\Gamma\\left\( \\tfrac{1}{n}\\right\) \\right\\rceil = n](https://www.johndcook.com/gamma_recip.svg)

We an illustrate this with the following Python code.
    
    
    >>> from scipy.special import gamma
    >>> from math import ceil
    >>> for n in range(1, 101):
        ... assert(ceil(gamma(1/n)) == n)
    

You can find a full proof in [1]. I'll give a partial proof that may be more informative than the full proof.

The asymptotic expansion of the gamma function near zero is

![\\Gamma\(z\) = \\frac{1}{z} - \\gamma + {\\cal O}\(z^2\)](https://www.johndcook.com/gamma_recip2.svg)

where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

So when we set  _z_ = 1/_n_ we find Γ(1/_n_) ≈  _n_ − γ +  _O_(1/_n_ ²). Since 0 < γ < 1, the theorem above is true for sufficiently large  _n_. And it turns out "sufficiently large" can be replaced with  _n_ ≥ 1.
