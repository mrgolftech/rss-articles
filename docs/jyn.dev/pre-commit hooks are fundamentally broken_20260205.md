# pre-commit hooks are fundamentally broken

2025-12-26  • [git](https://jyn.dev/tags/git/) • [workflows](https://jyn.dev/tags/workflows/) • [devtools](https://jyn.dev/tags/devtools/)

Let's start a new Rust project.
    
    
    $ mkdir best-fizzbuzz-ever
    $ cd best-fizzbuzz-ever
    $ cat << EOF > main.rs
    fn main() { for i in 0.. {
        println ("fizzbuzz");
    }}
    EOF
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/jyn/src/third-website/best-fizzbuzz-ever/.git/
    $ git add main.rs
    $ git commit --message fizzbuzz
    [main (root-commit) 661dc28] fizzbuzz
     1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 main.rs
    

Neat. Now let's say I add this to some list of fizzbuzz projects in different languages. Maybe .... [this one](https://github.com/joshkunz/fizzbuzz). They tell me I need to have "proper formatting" and "use consistent style". How rude.

Maybe I can write a pre-commit hook that checks that for me?
    
    
    $ cat << 'EOF' > pre-commit
    #!/bin/sh
    set -eu
    for f in *.rs; do
      rustfmt --check "$f"
    done
    EOF
    $ chmod +x pre-commit
    $ ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
    $ git add pre-commit
    $ git commit --message "add pre-commit hook"
    Diff in /home/jyn/src/third-website/best-fizzbuzz-ever/src/main.rs:1:
    -fn main() { for i in 0.. {
    -    println ("fizzbuzz");
    -}}
    +fn main() {
    +    for i in 0.. {
    +        println("fizzbuzz");
    +    }
    +}
    

Neat! Let's commit that change.
    
    
    $ rustfmt main.rs
    $ git commit --message "add pre-commit hook"
    [main 3be7b87] add pre-commit hook
     1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
     create mode 100755 pre-commit
    $ git status
    On branch main
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    	modified:   main.rs
    

Oh ... We fixed the formatting, but we didn't actually stage the changes. The pre-commit hook runs on the _working tree_ , not on the _index_ , so it didn't catch the issue. We can see that the version tracked by git still has the wrong formatting:
    
    
    $ git show HEAD:main.rs
    fn main() { for i in 0.. {
        println ("fizzbuzz");
    }}
    

Maybe we can make the script smarter? Let's checkout all the files in the index into a temporary directory and run our pre-commit hook there. 1
    
    
    $ cat << 'EOF' > pre-commit
    #!/bin/sh
    set -eu
    
    tmpdir=$(mktemp -d --tmpdir "$(basename "$(realpath .)")-pre-commit.XXXX")
    trap 'rm -r "$tmpdir"' EXIT
    git checkout-index --all --prefix="$tmpdir/"
    for f in $tmpdir/*.rs; do
      rustfmt --check "$f"
    done
    EOF
    $ git add pre-commit
    $ git commit --message "make pre-commit hook smarter"
    Diff in /tmp/best-fizzbuzz-ever-pre-commit.ZNyw/main.rs:1:
    -fn main() { for i in 0.. {
    -    println ("fizzbuzz");
    -}}
    +fn main() {
    +    for i in 0.. {
    +        println("fizzbuzz");
    +    }
    +}
    
    

Yay! That caught the issue. Now let's add our rust program to that collection of fizzbuzz programs.
    
    
    $ git add main.rs
    $ git commit --message "make pre-commit hook smarter"
    [main 3cb40f6] make pre-commit hook smarter
     2 files changed, 11 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

    $ git rebase upstream

Maybe we'll make one last tweak...
    
    
    $ sed -i '1i // Written by jyn' main.rs
    $ git commit main.rs --message "mark who wrote fizzbuzz"
    Diff in /tmp/best-fizzbuzz-ever-pre-commit.n1Pj/fizzbuzz-traits.rs:4:
     use std::iter;
    
     struct FizzBuzz {
    -    from : i32
    -  , to : i32
    +    from: i32,
    +    to: i32,
     }
    
     impl FizzBuzz {
    

Uh. Huh. Right. The code that was already here wasn't formatted according to rustfmt. Our script is running on every file in the git repo, so it won't let us commit.

Maybe we can change it to only run on modified files?
    
    
    $ cat << 'EOF' > pre-commit
    #!/bin/sh
    set -eu
    
    files=$(git diff --name-only --cached --no-ext-diff --diff-filter=d)
    
    tmpdir=$(mktemp -d --tmpdir "$(basename "$(realpath .)")-pre-commit.XXXX")
    trap 'rm -r "$tmpdir"' EXIT
    
    printf %s "$files" | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 git checkout-index --prefix="$tmpdir/"
    for f in $tmpdir/*.rs; do
      rustfmt --check "$f"
    done
    EOF
    $ git commit main.rs pre-commit \
      --message "update main.rs; make pre-commit even smarter"
    [main f2925bc] update main.rs; make pre-commit even smarter
     2 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
    

Alright. Cool.

Let's do one last thing. Let's say we had an existing PR to this repo and we need to rebase it. Maybe it had a merge conflict, or maybe there was a fix on main that we need in order to implement our solution.
    
    
    $ git checkout upstream/HEAD  # Simulate an old PR by checking out an old commit
    HEAD is now at 56bf3ab Adds E to the README
    $ echo 'fn main() { println!("this counts as fizzbuzz, right?"); }' > print.rs
    $ git add print.rs
    $ git commit --message "Add print.rs"
    [detached HEAD 3d1bbf7] Add print.rs
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 100644 print.rs
    

And let's also say that we want to edit the commit message.
    
    
    $ git rebase -i main  # Rebase this whole branch over our main branch
    reword 3d1bbf7 Add print.rs
    # Rebase f2925bc..3d1bbf7 onto f2925bc (1 command)
    

## Now, we _really_ have a problem.
    
    
    Error: file `/tmp/best-fizzbuzz-ever-pre-commit.p3az/*.rs` does not exist
    Could not apply 3d1bbf7... Add print.rs
    

Two things went wrong here:

  1. Our pre-commit hook can't handle commits that don't have any Rust files.
  2. Our pre-commit hook _ran on a branch we were rebasing_. 2



Fixing the first thing doesn't really help us, because we don't control other people's branches. They might have used `git commit --no-verify`. They might not even have a pre-commit hook installed. They might have had a branch that passed the hook when they originally wrote it, but not after a rebase (e.g. if your hook is `cargo check` or something like that). They might have had a branch that used an old version of the hook that didn't have as many checks as a later version.

Our only real choice here is to pass `--no-verify` to `git rebase` every time we run it, and to `git commit` for every commit in the rebase we modify, and possibly even to every `git merge` we run outside of a rebase.

This is because pre-commit hooks are a _fundamentally broken idea_. Code does not exist in isolation. Commits that are local to a developer machine do not ever go through CI. Commits don't even necessarily mean that that the code is ready to publish—pre-commit hooks don't run on `git stash` for a reason! I don't use `git stash`, I use `git commit` so that my stashes are tied to a branch, and hooks completely break this workflow.

More than that, pre-commit hooks are _preventing you from saving your work_. There should be a _really, really good reason_ to prevent you from saving your work, and IMO "doesn't pass the test suite" is not that. I have similar feelings about format-on-save hooks.

There are a [bunch](https://blog.plover.com/prog/git/hook-disaster.html) of [other](https://dev.to/afl_ext/are-pre-commit-git-hooks-a-good-idea-i-dont-think-so-38j6) [footguns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77620) with pre-commit hooks. This doesn't even count the fact that nearly all pre-commit hooks are implemented in a broken way and just blindly run on the worktree, and are slow or unreliable or both. Don't get me started on pre-commit hooks that try to add things to the commit you're about to make, or projects that try to automatically install a hook when you run the test suite.

The [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework (or its cousin, [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged)) does _not_ fix this. It fixes the issues about running on the index by stashing your changes with [`--keep-index`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#Documentation/git-stash.txt---keep-index), which works but modifies your git state. It doesn't fix the issues about running during a rebase, nor does it prevent hooks from trying to add things to the current commit. 3

"Just don't write bad hooks" doesn't work if I'm working on someone else's project where I don't control the hook.

Please just don't use `pre-commit` hooks. Use `pre-push` instead. 4 `pre-push` hooks nearly avoid all of these issues.

The only use case where I think pre-commit hooks are a good idea is for things that must _never_ committed, that are worth interrupting a complicated rebase to prevent; namely: credentials. Once credentials are committed they're quite difficult to get out, and even harder to be sure you haven't missed them.

## Tips for writing a `pre-push` hook

  * Run on the index, not the working tree, as described above. 5
  * Only add checks that are fast and reliable. Checks that touch the network should never go in a hook. Checks that are slow and require an up-to-date build cache should never go in a hook. Checks that require credentials or a running local service should never go in a hook.
  * Be as quiet as possible. This hook is running buried inside a bunch of other commands, often without the developer knowing that the hook is going to run. Don't hide other important output behind a wall of progress messages.
  * Don't set the hook up automatically. Whatever tool you use that promises to make this reliable is wrong. There is not a way to do this reliably, and the number of times it's broken on me is more than I can count. Please just add docs for how to set it up manually, prominantly featured in your CONTRIBUTING docs. (You do have contributing docs, right?)



If the hook does fail, and the changes affect an older commit than the most recent, you can use a combination of [`git-absorb`](https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb), [`git-revise`](https://git-revise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html), and [`git rebase -X ours --exec`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---execcmd) to put them in the appropriate commit before pushing again.

And don't write `pre-commit` hooks!

  1. This is really quite slow on large enough repos, but there's not any real alternative. `git stash --keep-index` messes with git index state and also with your stashes. The only VCS that exposes a FUSE filesystem of its commits is [Sapling](https://github.com/facebook/sapling/blob/main/eden/fs/docs/Overview.md), which is poorly supported outside Facebook. The best you can do is give up on looking at the whole working copy and only write hooks that read a single file at a time. ↩

  2. By default this doesn't happen when running bare `rebase`, but the second you add `--interactive`, nearly anything you do runs a hook. Hooks will also run when you attempt to resolve merge conflicts. ↩

  3. `lint-staged` does actually have a `--fail-on-changes` flag which aborts the commit, but that still modifies the working tree, and it's not on by default. ↩

  4. For more info about the difference, and a full list of possible hooks, see [`man 5 githooks`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks). ↩

  5. Notice that I don't say "only run on changed files". That's because it's [not actually possible to reliably determine which branch the current commit is based on](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAHnEOG2o784dk+OpkGt-1qjRJb34=sFMJvh-JRJ3v+GNBxFywQ@mail.gmail.com/), the best you can do is pick a random branch that looks likely. ↩
