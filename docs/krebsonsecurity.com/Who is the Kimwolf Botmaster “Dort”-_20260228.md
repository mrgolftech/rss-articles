{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/', 'value': '<p>In early January 2026, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how a security researcher disclosed a vulnerability that was used to build <strong>Kimwolf</strong>, the world&#8217;s largest and most disruptive botnet. Since then, the person in control of Kimwolf &#8212; who goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Dort</strong>&#8221; &#8212; has coordinated a barrage of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), doxing and email flooding attacks against the researcher and this author, and more recently caused a SWAT team to be sent to the researcher&#8217;s home. This post examines what is knowable about Dort based on public information.</p>\n<p>A public &#8220;dox&#8221; created in 2020 asserted Dort was a teenager from Canada (DOB August 2003) who used the aliases &#8220;<strong>CPacket</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>M1ce</strong>.&#8221; A search on the username CPacket at the open source intelligence platform <strong>OSINT Industries</strong> finds a <strong>GitHub</strong> account under the names Dort and CPacket that was created in 2017 using the email address <strong>jay.miner232@gmail.com</strong>.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_73247" style="width: 759px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-73247" height="537" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cpacket-discord.png" width="749" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-73247">Image: osint.industries.</p></div>\n<p>The cyber intelligence firm <strong>Intel 471</strong> says jay.miner232@gmail.com was used between 2015 and 2019 to create accounts at multiple cybercrime forums, including <strong>Nulled</strong> (username &#8220;Uubuntuu&#8221;) and <strong>Cracked </strong>(user &#8220;Dorted&#8221;); Intel 471 reports that both of these accounts were created from the same Internet address at Rogers Canada (99.241.112.24).</p>\n<p>Dort was an extremely active player in the Microsoft game <strong>Minecraft</strong> who gained notoriety for their &#8220;<strong>Dortware</strong>&#8221; software that helped players cheat. But somewhere along the way, Dort graduated from hacking Minecraft games to enabling far more serious crimes.</p>\n<p>Dort also used the nickname <strong>DortDev</strong>, an identity that was active in March 2022 on the chat server for the prolific cybercrime group known as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/lapsus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LAPSUS$</a>. Dort peddled a service for registering temporary email addresses, as well as &#8220;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/dort/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dortsolver</a>,&#8221; code that could bypass various CAPTCHA services designed to prevent automated account abuse. Both of these offerings were advertised in 2022 on <strong>SIM Land</strong>, a Telegram channel dedicated to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SIM-swapping</a> and account takeover activity.</p>\n<p>The cyber intelligence firm <strong>Flashpoint </strong>indexed 2022 posts on SIM Land by Dort that show this person developed the disposable email and CAPTCHA bypass services with the help of another hacker who went by the handle &#8220;<strong>Qoft</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I legit just work with Jacob,&#8221; Qoft said in 2022 in reply to another user, referring to their exclusive business partner Dort. In the same conversation, Qoft bragged that the two had stolen more than $250,000 worth of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Xbox Game Pass accounts</a> by developing a program that mass-created Game Pass identities using stolen payment card data.<span id="more-73057"></span></p>\n<p>Who is the Jacob that Qoft referred to as their business partner? The breach tracking service <strong>Constella Intelligence</strong> finds the password used by jay.miner232@gmail.com was reused by just one other email address: <strong>jacobbutler803@gmail.com</strong>. Recall that the 2020 dox of Dort said their date of birth was August 2003 (8/03).</p>\n<p>Searching this email address at <strong>DomainTools.com</strong> reveals it was used in 2015 to register several Minecraft-themed domains, all assigned to a Jacob Butler in Ottawa, Canada and to the Ottawa phone number 613-909-9727.</p>\n<p><strong>Constella Intelligence</strong> finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com was used to register an account on the hacker forum Nulled in 2016, as well as the account name &#8220;M1CE&#8221; on Minecraft. Pivoting off the password used by their Nulled account shows it was shared by the email addresses<strong> j.a.y.m.iner232@gmail.com</strong> and <strong>jbutl3@ocdsb.ca</strong>, the latter being an address at a domain for the <strong>Ottawa-Carelton District School Board</strong>.</p>\n<p>Data indexed by the breach tracking service <strong>Spycloud</strong> suggests that at one point Jacob Butler shared a computer with his mother and a sibling, which might explain why their email accounts were connected to the password &#8220;jacobsplugs.&#8221; Neither Jacob nor any of the other Butler household members responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The open source intelligence service <strong>Epieos</strong> finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com created the GitHub account &#8220;<strong>MemeClient</strong>.&#8221; Meanwhile, Flashpoint indexed a deleted anonymous Pastebin.com post from 2017 declaring that MemeClient was the creation of a user named CPacket &#8212; one of Dort&#8217;s early monikers.</p>\n<p>Why is Dort so mad? On January 2, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network</a>, which explored research into the botnet by <strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong>, founder of the proxy tracking service <strong>Synthient</strong>. Brundage figured out that the Kimwolf botmasters were exploiting a little-known weakness in residential proxy services to infect poorly-defended devices &#8212; like TV boxes and digital photo frames &#8212; plugged into the internal, private networks of proxy endpoints.</p>\n<p>By the time that story went live, most of the vulnerable proxy providers had been notified by Brundage and had fixed the weaknesses in their systems. That vulnerability remediation process massively slowed Kimwolf&#8217;s ability to spread, and within hours of the story&#8217;s publication Dort created a Discord server in my name that began publishing personal information about and violent threats against Brundage, Yours Truly, and others.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_73249" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-73249" height="652" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-flyswat.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-73249">Dort and friends incriminating themselves by planning swatting attacks in a public Discord server.</p></div>\n<p>Last week, Dort and friends used that same Discord server (then named &#8220;Krebs&#8217;s Koinbase Kallers&#8221;) to threaten a swatting attack against Brundage, again posting his home address and personal information. Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity that local police officers subsequently visited his home in response to a swatting hoax which occurred around the same time that another member of the server posted a door emoji and taunted Brundage further.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_73245" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-73245" height="155" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-door.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-73245">Dort, using the alias &#8220;Meow,&#8221; taunts Synthient founder Ben Brundage with a picture of a door.</p></div>\n<p>Someone on the server then linked to a cringeworthy (and NSFW) new Soundcloud <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dortdev/larpgod" rel="noopener" target="_blank">diss track</a> recorded by the user DortDev that included a stickied message from Dort saying, &#8220;Ur dead nigga. u better watch ur fucking back. sleep with one eye open. bitch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty hefty penny for a new front door,&#8221; the diss track intoned. &#8220;If his head doesn&#8217;t get blown off by SWAT officers. What&#8217;s it like not having a front door?&#8221;</p>\n<p class="p1">With any luck, Dort will soon be able to tell us all exactly what it&#8217;s like.</p>'}
