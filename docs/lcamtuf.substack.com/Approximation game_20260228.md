{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://lcamtuf.substack.com/feed', 'value': '<p>In some of the earlier articles on this blog, we talked about the <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/unreal-numbers">nature of real numbers</a> and the <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/how-has-mathematics-gotten-so-abstract">meanings of infinity</a>. The theory outlined in these posts is interesting but also hopelessly abstract. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re inventing make-believe worlds that have no discernible connection to reality.</p><p>In today&#8217;s post, let&#8217;s look at a cool counterexample: a surprising outcome of an numerical experiment that can be backed up with fairly simple proofs, but that makes sense only if you consider the construction of real numbers and rationals.</p><p>We start by picking a real number <em>r</em>. Your job is to approximate it as closely as possible using a small rational fraction <em>a / b</em>. Is this task easier if <em>r</em> itself is rational or irrational?</p><p>Before we dive in, we ought to specify an additional rule: to avoid trivial solutions, we&#8217;re looking for close but inexact matches. In other words, your <em>a / b</em> can&#8217;t be the same as  <em>r</em>. For simplicity, we&#8217;ll also stick to positive <em>r </em>and positive fraction denominators throughout the article.</p><h3>Defining &#8220;good&#8221;</h3><p>For a chosen denominator <em>b</em>, it&#8217;s pretty easy to find the value of <em>a </em>that gets us the closest to the target <em>r</em>. We must consider two cases: the largest &#8220;low-side&#8221; fraction that&#8217;s still less than <em>r</em>; and the smallest &#8220;high-side&#8221; fraction<em> </em>greater than<em> r. </em>Again, if there&#8217;s a rational fraction that matches <em>r</em> exactly, that solution is verboten by the rules of the game; we need to pick one of the nearby values instead.</p><p>If you <em>wanted to</em> find an exact match, you could try <em>a<sub>ideal</sub> = r &#183; b</em>; this makes the <em>a / b</em> fraction equal to <em>r &#183; b / b =</em> <em>r</em>. That said, <em>r &#183; b </em>might not be an integer (or even a rational number), so the approach is a bust.</p><p>If we round the value up (&#8968;<em>r &#183; b</em>&#8969;), we get a number that is equal or greater than <em>a<sub>ideal</sub></em>; if it&#8217;s greater, the difference between the two values will be less than 1. In other words, we can write the following inequality:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>This is saying that the rounded-up number<em> </em>may be equal to what we need for an exact match for <em>r</em>, or it might overshoot it, but always by less than the minimum possible increment of the numerator in the <em>a / b</em> fraction (+1).</p><p>The result is <em>almost</em> what we need, but once more, the rules prohibit approximations that are exactly equal to <em>r</em>. The workaround is to subtract 1 from all sides of the inequality:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The effectively tells us that the middle term &#8212; &#8968;<em>r &#183; b</em>&#8969; - 1<em> &#8212; </em>is always less than the value needed to match <em>r</em>, and the difference is never greater than a single tick of the numerator. We&#8217;re as close as we can be; the value of <em>a </em>for the optimal low-side approximation (<em>a / b </em>&lt;<em> r) </em>is:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>We can follow the same thought process to find the high-side numerator (<em>a / b </em>&gt;<em> r)</em>:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>Finally, the error (<em>&#949;</em>) associated with any <em>a / b</em> can be easily calculated as:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>We have previously established that if we pick <em>a<sub>low </sub></em>or <em>a<sub>high</sub></em>, the error can&#8217;t exceed one tick of the numerator, which works out to &#177; 1/<em>b</em>. As a practical example, if we&#8217;re trying to approximate <em>r = </em>2 using <em>b = </em>4, the best inexact solutions are 7/4 on the low side and 9/4 on the high side; they both have an error of 1/<em>b.</em></p><p>Next, we&#8217;ll try to examine if the error can be less. If we find any approximations that are better than the worst-case scenario &#8212; i.e., that satisfy <em>&#949; </em>&lt; 1/<em>b</em> &#8212; we&#8217;re gonna call them 1-<em>good.</em></p><p>As an inspection aid, we can also define a score (<em>s</em>) calculated by multiplying <em>&#949;</em> by <em>b</em>:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The equation normalizes the maximum error to 1 regardless of the denominator we&#8217;ve chosen. By that metric, a 1-good approximation is any with a value of <em>s</em> &lt; 1.</p><h3>The rational test case</h3><p>Now that we have the criteria figured out, let&#8217;s take <em>r = </em>1/4 and analyze the optimal solutions for a couple of initial values of <em>b:</em></p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>We find out that many approximations are 1-good (<em>&#949;</em> &lt; 1/<em>b</em>, aka <em>s</em> &lt; 1), beating their higher-magnitude peers: for example, 1/5 is clearly better than 2/6. Nevertheless, the results are underwhelming: the values diverge from the 1/<em>b</em> baseline by unremarkably small factors that are stuck on repeat. If we plot a larger sample, we get:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZWwG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0009ed6d-03a4-4777-973b-afcb6457f9dd_2500x1250.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp" /><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="728" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZWwG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0009ed6d-03a4-4777-973b-afcb6457f9dd_2500x1250.png" width="1456" /><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg fill="none" height="20" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image" tabindex="0" type="button"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2" fill="none" height="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Approximations of r = 1/4.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the plot, which uses log scale, I also included a diagonal line that represents error values decreasing with the <em>square</em> of the denominator (1/<em>b</em>&#178;). Approximations for which the error dips below this line would be markedly better than the ones that merely dip below 1/<em>b</em>. We can label these 1/<em>b</em>&#178; solutions as <em>2-good</em>.</p><p>For rational values of <em>r</em>, we get a handful of initial approximations below the 2-good line, but we can prove that the effect can&#8217;t last. We start by rewriting <em>r </em>as a fraction of two integers: <em>r</em> = <em>p </em>/ <em>q</em>. The 2-goodness criteria is <em>&#949; </em>&lt;<em> </em>1/<em>b</em>&#178;. We&#8217;ve previously defined <em>&#949; </em>=<em> </em>| <em>r - a/b </em>| and by the rules of the game, it must be greater than zero. Putting it all together, we can write this inequality:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>To tidy up, we can bring the fractions in the middle to a common denominator:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The denominator is a positive number, so there&#8217;s no harm in taking it out of the absolute-value section and multiplying all sides of the inequality by it:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>All the variables here are integers. If <em>b &#8805; q</em>, the fraction on the right is necessarily less or equal to one. That creates an issue because it implies the following:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The middle section must be an integer too, so the only solution that fits the right-hand inequality is <em>b &#183; p - a &#183; q = </em>0. That solution creates a contradiction on the left: 0 &lt; 0. We conclude that there are no integer <em>a, b, p, </em>and <em>q</em> that satisfy the inequality for <em>b &#8805; q</em>. If any inexact 2-good approximations of rational numbers exist, they can only exist for <em>b &lt; q. </em>That&#8217;s where we look next.</p><p>For the next step, note that the variable <em>q</em> is the denominator of the number we&#8217;re approximating, so it is constant for a given <em>r. </em>The <em>b</em> &lt; <em>q </em>condition can only be met by <em>a / b</em> pairs with smaller denominators. In other words, for rationals, if rule-compliant 2-good solutions exist, there&#8217;s a tight upper bound on their number &#8212; and they must be clustered near the beginning of the plot.</p><p>This is about as much as we can squeeze out of that stone: rational numbers appear to be difficult to approximate using other rationals. The only winning move is to cram more digits into <em>a / b</em>.</p><h3>Approximating irrationals</h3><p>If rational fractions are tough, what about irrational numbers?

In particular, for each integer <em>k</em> from 0 to some arbitrary upper bound <em>K</em>, we can calculate <em>k &#183; r </em>and split it to obtain a sequence of integer parts (<em>v</em><sub>0 </sub>to <em>v</em><sub>K</sub>) and fractional parts (<em>x</em><sub>0 </sub>to <em>x</em><sub>K</sub>), e.g.:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The sequence of fractional parts has K + 1 elements; again, each of the elements falls somewhere in the interval [0, 1). </p><p>Next, we divide the [0, 1) interval into K sub-intervals (&#8220;buckets&#8221;) of equal size:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>We have K buckets and <em>K + </em>1 fractional parts to toss in; no matter what the values of the fractional parts may be, at least two elements will necessarily end up in the same bucket. This is the <em>pigeonhole principle.</em></p><p>Again, the consequence is that there&#8217;s at least one pair of indices, <em>g</em> &lt; <em>h, </em>such that <em>x<sub>g </sub></em>and <em>x<sub>h</sub></em> both fell into the same bucket. We don&#8217;t know anything about the underlying values, except that by the virtue of where they are, they must be spaced less than 1 / <em>K</em> apart:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>Each fractional part can be restated as the difference between the original multiple of <em>r</em> and the associated integer part <em>v</em>. That is to say, we can rewrite the earlier inequality as:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>Next, let&#8217;s rearrange the terms to split out expressions that form two independent integers: (<em>v<sub>h </sub></em>- <em>v<sub>g</sub></em>) and (<em>h - g</em>). We label these <em>a </em>and <em>b:</em></p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>Note that the value of <em>b</em> is positive (because we specified <em>g &lt; h</em>) and that it&#8217;s necessarily less or equal than <em>K</em> (because it represents the difference of indices in a list with <em>K</em> + 1 elements).</p><p>The simplified form of the equation is:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>We&#8217;ll come back to the flag later; for now, let&#8217;s power through and divide both sides by <em>b</em>. We get:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The left-hand portion of the expression is the same as our earlier formula for the approximation error, <em>&#949; = </em>|<em> r - a / b </em>|<em>. </em>As for the right-hand part, recall that <em>b </em>doesn&#8217;t exceed <em>K.</em> Therefore, the expression in the denominator &#8212; K<em> &#183; b &#8212; </em>must be equal or greater than<em> b&#178;</em>. Putting it all together, we have established that for any real number <em>r,</em> there exists some integer <em>a </em>and <em>b </em>such that <em>a / b</em> satisfies <em>&#949; &lt; </em>1/<em>b&#178;</em>.</p><p>This proof is known as <em>Dirichlet&#8217;s approximation theorem</em>. At first blush, it only tells us that one 2-good approximation is guaranteed for every real. In fact, that solution might not even comply with the rules of our game because it might be exact (i.e., <em>&#949; = </em>0).</p><p>To take the next step &#8212; we&#8217;re getting close to the finish line! &#8212; note that the proof doesn&#8217;t put any special constraint on the value of <em>K. </em>Let&#8217;s come back to an equation flagged (&#9873;) several paragraphs earlier, but rewrite it for some definite <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>. We label the resulting pair <em>a</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The left-hand part is equal to the approximation error (|<em> r - a</em><sub>1</sub><em> / b</em><sub>1</sub><em> </em>|) multiplied by <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>; we&#8217;ll label this <em>s</em>. For rational numbers, <em>s</em> may be equal or greater than zero. For irrational numbers, it&#8217;s always positive because subtracting <em>a</em><sub>1 </sub>from <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> &#183; <em>r </em>(<em>a</em> &#8712; &#8484;, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> &#8712; &#8484;<sub>+</sub>) will always leave some fractional part.</p><p>We&#8217;re more interested in the irrational case, so let&#8217;s look at that first. We have <em>a</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1 </sub>associated with <em>K</em><sub>1</sub> &#8212; but what if we choose a different starting value <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>? Well, it will give us some new <em>a</em><sub>2 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>; that said, we don&#8217;t know yet if these values are different from <em>a</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>.</p><p>For a moment, let&#8217;s assume that <em>a</em><sub>2</sub><em> = a</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>2 </sub><em>= b</em><sub>1</sub> for any <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>; in essence, we&#8217;re saying that <em>m</em> is constant. However, <em>m</em> is a positive real, so it stands to reason that once <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> becomes large enough, the inequality must flip: <em>m &#8805; </em>1/<em>K</em><sub>2</sub>. This produces a contradiction: at that point, <em>a</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> no longer fit. In other words, it must be that for some<em> K</em><sub>2 </sub>&gt; <em>K</em><sub>1</sub><em>, </em>we need a new, distinct <em>a</em><sub>2 </sub>/ <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>. When approximating irrational numbers, we can keep incrementing <em>K</em> to conjure as many distinct 2-good pairs as we want.</p><p>But what about the rational case where <em>r </em>can be written as<em> p / q?</em> Here, we might be starting with a non-zero <em>m</em>, but the generation process can&#8217;t continue indefinitely. To show this, we can rewrite the left-hand expression from the earlier inequality as:</p><div class="latex-rendered"></div><p>The numerator of this fraction is an integer (because so are <em>a</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em>, and <em>q</em>). The denominator is also an integer and is constant for a given <em>r. </em>It follows that the minimum decrement for the fraction is 1/<em>q</em>. If we keep ramping up <em>K</em>, the solution will move in discrete increments toward the degenerate case of <em>m = 0</em>. At that point, <em>m</em> satisfies any 1/<em>K</em> and the generation of new 2-good pairs stops.</p><p>In other words, in our thought experiment, you get an infinite supply of surprisingly accurate approximations of irrational numbers, but only a handful of decent (inexact) approximations for rationals.</p><h3>But&#8230; why?</h3><p>Right. The proofs are interesting but don&#8217;t offer an intuitive explanation of why we&#8217;re seeing these patterns. This is where we go back to my opening remark: it&#8217;s easier to grasp the outcome if you look at how rational numbers and reals are &#8220;made&#8221;.</p><p>From the construction of rationals, we know that the spacing between them is arbitrarily close, but at any &#8220;magnification level&#8221; &#8212; for any chosen denominator <em>b </em>&#8212; the values divide the continuum into uniform intervals. Uniform spacing also implies <em>maximal</em> spacing, even though there is no upper or lower bound to the values of <em>a / b</em>. Any new value inserted onto the number line will necessarily sit &#8220;closer&#8221; to an existing rational.</p><p>The gaps between rationals are where irrational numbers live. This comes with a lot of weird baggage we talked about in the earlier article, but it also means that for any given irrational <em>r, </em>we have an inexhaustible supply of unexpectedly accurate rational approximations in the vicinity.</p><p>Although the puzzle we started with might seem silly, the study of these structures &#8212; known as <em>Diophantine approximations</em> &#8212; is taken seriously and gets complex really fast. For example, it&#8217;s possible to construct so-called <em>Liouville numbers</em> that have an infinite irrationality exponent (endless <em>n-good </em>approximations for any <em>n)</em>, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to prove that there&#8217;s any commonly-encountered number with an irrationality exponent greater than two. In the same vein, algebraic irrationals (e.g., &#8730;2) all have an irrationality measure of two, but the proof of this is fiendishly difficult and netted its discoverer the Fields Medal back in 1958.</p><div><hr /></div><p><em>You might also enjoy my other articles about math, including:</em></p><div class="digest-post-embed"></div><div class="digest-post-embed"></div><div class="digest-post-embed"></div><p><em>I write well-researched, original articles about geek culture, electronic circuit design, algorithms, and more.
