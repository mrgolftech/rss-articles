# Turns out I was wrong about TDD

January 25, 2026 · [Martin Alderson](/)

I've been a TDD sceptic for most of my career. The economics never made sense - why spend hours writing tests for features that might not survive first contact with users? Then coding agents came along and completely flipped the calculation.

## How I used to think about testing

I've worked on a lot of different projects over the years. I was most comfortable heavily leaning into e2e based tests, running against the full application running in Docker.

Combined with TestContainers (which is awesome!) it was very easy to spin up a complete copy of your entire infrastructure and run it against each commit. I tended to combine browser based testing with API testing, where you would run through each use case of the app and run the API requests the client would make in sequence and assert various parts.

Depending on the project, there would be some level unit testing for core 'calculations' or 'business logic', with projects with complex financial or business logic requiring more unit tests.

I found this very successful - in my experience so many bugs and errors in software aren't caught by unit tests per sé, especially in complex web or mobile apps. The _hard_ bit about these apps is the very complex interplay between the client, state, backend, caches, message queues, databases and often 3rd party services at various levels of the stack. Unit tests tend to avoid testing this (by definition).

The issue with heavy e2e testing is it is slow. You have to spin up all the related infrastructure, start your application(s), seed data, and then execute the tests. Browser based tests are especially slow, as you now need to run browser(s) to execute the workflows. We'll come back to this later, but LLMs change the calculus on this directly in my experience.

## TDD scepticism

I definitely used to think of myself as a TDD sceptic. While I've always seen the promise of it, in my experience it often led to codebases that were optimised to be easy to test, but _not_ focussed on _product outcomes_. To be clear, for some codebases this is the correct outcome. If you're building highly critical software which has a highly defined use case (that doesn't change much), then optimising for this is the right call. Stability/reliability actually is the most important product outcome.

I've been involved with some codebases that had definitely drank the TDD kool-aid too much. It was clear there was pushback on product changes based on how difficult it was to update the codebases _tests_. If you've done TDD and your product definition changes dramatically, it can result in an awful lot of tests going in the bin and a lot of new ones having to be written. Often this is for seemingly (product facing) trivial things that change a lot of assumptions about the data model of the product at hand.

I'm sure you could (and there will be many that do!) argue that actually this is the whole point - TDD makes you really think hard about how you are going to build reliable, testable software upfront and avoid the technical debt of it later down the line. The issue though is that this often led to a culture of treating the tests as _more_ important than user requirements, which often ended up with _so much_ time being spent writing tests for features that didn't get user traction and were deleted anyway[1].

## Enter LLMs

So now we've established how I used to think about testing. Coding agents have totally changed the ballgame on this. I mentioned e2e testing was slow before - and this is true, but if you're doing things at "human speed" you're probably spending most of your time writing code, and much less waiting for tests to pass (though it does get frustrating when you are stuck in a _slow_ fix test -> wait for tests to pass -> fail -> try again cycle that I'm sure many are all too familiar with on certain projects).

> When you're shipping features faster with agents, waiting for tests becomes a much larger proportion of your time.

I quickly noticed that when I was working with Claude Code, I seemed to be spending nearly _all_ my time waiting for e2e test cases to pass. And worse, the output of these tests (especially browser based) are difficult for LLMs to reason about - LLMs still don't work brilliantly with screenshots, and the test output can be enormous.

This resulted in often comically bad results where it'd read the test failure screenshots, decide it was working brilliantly (when it clearly wasn't!) and then get confused why it was still failing and generally reasoning itself into the nearest psychiatric ward.

Even worse, I was noticing that small regressions were starting to creep in even when the tests did pass. Subtle behaviour and data bugs were starting to mount up, which required me to keep a _very_ close eye on all the changes the agent was building and interrupting it all the time. This was almost certainly confounded with the models being dramatically worse back then, but I was seemingly spending all my time staring at either Claude Code output _or_ test log output.

## Where I'm at now

After much trial and error I feel I've got into a far better place with this. I'm not sure if you'd call it TDD - but for each 'ticket' I give an agent, I ask it to come up with a testing plan _before_ implementing[2]. I don't necessarily require it to write the tests first then get them passing, but the idea is me and the agent debate on the best testing approach for a feature ahead of time.

I've leaned far heavier into unit testing and integration testing (on mostly "mocked" infrastructure, vs the e2e approach I discussed before) as well. While I still have a bunch of e2e tests that run on PR, I instruct the agent to just ensure unit and integration tests are passing, and then make a PR which CI will then run e2e against. This seems to strike the right balance - the agent can run the fast tests locally, and then at PR review any failing e2e tests are flagged before merge (which I can then tell the agent to fix). The agent can write all these unit and integration tests in seconds, and it really doesn't matter if the feature flops and needs to be deleted.

The other interesting approach I've done when I do come across a bug is while working on the bug ticket, get the agent to explain _why_ this was missed in our test suite while fixing it. Then add test case(s) _specifically_ for this edge case, covering the reasons outlined before[3].

This is obviously just best practice - not some new breakthrough! But in highly iterative products there often just wasn't enough time or resources to add detailed test cases for _every single_ edge case that came up - you'd have to do some level of triage to decide what was worth writing good test cases for.

LLMs clearly change the economics of this, and now even quite simple hobby projects I've made with agents end up with 1,000+ test cases - some of them quite basic, but a lot really running through real use and edge cases.

I now somewhat shudder looking back at quite how fragile some of the human written projects were, test coverage wise.

## The hidden benefits

The side effect of this is you end up codifying _so much_ behaviour of the app in the tests. The agent _has_ to understand these subtle edge cases, because the tests won't pass otherwise. And as the models and agent harnesses continue to get better and better they figure the inferred meaning of the failing tests far better.

The other surprising benefit is reviewing LLM PRs gets a lot easier. Reviewing the code from an LLM is a lot easier when you know all the tests are passing. Now what I do is start by reviewing the new or updated test files - not the actual implementation code.

This has two benefits. Firstly, if me and the agent did a good job of defining the tests and these pass, I can be pretty confident the code at least does what it should do - and I can focus review time on other things.

Secondly, I can quickly see if the LLM has "cheated" by simplifying/removing the tests. It's a clear giveaway if some test file has suddenly had a few tests removed that probably some weird edge case has come along, and the agent has decided to be lazy and remove it instead. This doesn't happen very often, with some careful instructions in AGENTS.md to tell it _not_ to do this, but it's still another good sanity check.

Everything I read about TDD and testing _was_ correct and I was wrong. However, it required basically infinite close-to-free "labour" in the form of agents for me to get the economics right for most projects.

The results I've got from this approach are genuinely impressive to me. I've built some really complex pipelines that I keep thinking are going to break every time I do a change with an agent, but _don't_. Maybe I'm just kicking the can further and further down the line, but I haven't hit the 'ceiling' yet.

Turns out the TDD folks were right all along. They just needed a mass-produced army of robotic junior devs to make it practical.

  1. You can easily go the wrong way with this though. Like everything in life, there are compromises and things sit on a spectrum. I've equally seen products crash and burn because they had _far too little_ test coverage and the product just becomes a huge game of regression whack-a-mole. ↩︎

  2. A good prompt I've found for this is along the lines of "Please include a section in your plan about how we should test this. Think through common uses and edge cases of this feature, and think the best way to cover these with tests" ↩︎

  3. I've also found code coverage tools really useful. I've often just set an agent off to improve code coverage of some poorly tested execution branches, again debating with it the best way to go about it. I've also found it good to make it come up with real life examples of how this branch would get triggered to avoid `expect(1+1).toBe(2)` style assertion tests. ↩︎
