# I broke and fixed my Ghost blog

October 16, 2025

Once a month I will pull down the latest docker images for this server and update the site. The Ghost CMS team updates things at a pretty regular pace so I try to not let an update sit for too long. 

With this last round I suddenly found myself locked out of my Ghost admin panel. I was pretty confident that I hadn't forgotten my password and when I was looking at the logs, I saw this pretty spooky error.

I was surprised by this sudden error, especially when I dumped out the database and confirmed that the hashed password for my Ghost user matched the password I was giving it. If you want to try that, this is the guide I followed: <https://hostarmada.com/tutorials/blog-cms/ghost/how-to-change-the-admin-password-of-your-ghost-blog-if-you-get-locked-out/>

### Maybe I messed up the Nginx?

So Ghost is a good CMS system, but it can be a little bit slow under load from automated scraping from RSS readers. I want to cache everything that I can with Nginx, so I use Nginx to store a lot of that junk. My configuration is not too terribly clever and has worked up to this point.

          default                    off;

          application/javascript     max;
          ~image/                    max;
      }

          listen 80;
          listen [::]:80;

              proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
          }
    
          # Public content - cached
          location / {
              proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
              proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
              proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
              proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
              proxy_buffering on;
              proxy_cache STATIC;
              proxy_cache_valid 200 1d;
              proxy_cache_use_stale error timeout invalid_header updating http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;

              proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
              proxy_redirect off;
          }
      }

The basic point is to get caching on the public content and then definitely NOT cache the ghost admin panel. After some testing, I confirmed this seemed to all work. But I was still locked out. 

### To the changelog!

Alright so I still couldn't figure out what was going on, so I went through the docs. Then I found this seemingly new addition. <https://docs.ghost.org/config?_ga=2.92846045.1713439663.1760543217-1048546310.1760543217#security>

Now I have transactional email set up, but just looking at the error it seemed to feel related. So I added: `security__staffDeviceVerification: false` to my docker-compose file to disable this new feature and then blamo, suddenly works fine. 

So if you are locked out of your Docker CMS admin panel, disable this (temporarily hopefully because it's a good feature) to let you continue to log in, debug your transactional email and then turn it back on. Hope that helps.
