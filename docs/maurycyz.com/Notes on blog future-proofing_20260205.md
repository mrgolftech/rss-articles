# _Notes on blog future-proofing_

**2026-01-23** ([Web sites](/tags/blog/)) 

_One of the great things about[web pages](/misc/starting_a_blog/) is that they are long-lived and mutable_. There's no need to aim for perfection on the first draft: A page can continue to be improved for years after its original publication. 

However, this mutability comes at a cost: 

[![](/misc/futureproofing/first_server.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Web_Server.jpg) DO NOT POWER [IT] DOWN!! -- The first web server.

Servers are just computers: If they ever break or are turned off, the web site vanishes off the internet.

_If you've ever been reading something more than a few years old_ , you've probably noticed that [none of the links work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). Even if the destination site still exists, It's common for them to have [changed the URL format](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) so that old links don't work. 

To be clear, links are a good thing: They allow readers to look deeper into a topic, and [external links](/real_pages/) are how we find new places on the internet. 

# Preserving external links:

_3rd party are services like[archive.org](https://archive.org/) are hit-and-miss_: By most accounts, only [around 50%](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6177) of pages ever make it to the archive, and even if they have a copy, it's still just a web site: Many other archiving services  have vanished or lost data. These services are good for archiving one's own site, but aren't great at defending against link rot. 

_If I want to be sure links will always work, they have to be archived locally._

I don't want to run a [crawler:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)

Unless carefully watched, these can place a lot of [load on the target](https://lwn.net/Articles/1008897/) server or/and fill up my disk with infinite dynamic pages: These could be intentional [honeypots](/babble/entry-point) or something as harmless as a web based calendar. 

I'd spend more time putting out fires than actually writing. 

With that in mind, I decided to use Chromium's "save" feature to archive single pages. This has one huge benefit over something like recursive wget: 

It saves the final DOM, not what was served over HTTP. 

_A lot of sites use Javascript to render content_ : For example, Substack uses it render math, and despite popular belief, there's more then just Nazis on there: It's also home to [Lcamtuf's](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/) excellent blog. Other sites go further by delivering all content as JSON and rendering it client side. You might think that only large corporate sites do this... [but that's just not the case](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/). 

These types of pages could be preserved with a caching proxy, but the odds that fifty megabytes of Javascript work in ten years are not good: 

It's better to run the Javascript now and save the results for later. 

Format choice

Chrome supports saving in two formats: MHTML and standard HTML with a directory to store the resources. 

On paper, [MHTML](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2557) very nice -- it's a standardized, single-file web archive with browser support -- unfortunately it's only really supported by Chrome: depending on a single application is not great for long-term preservation. 

Right now, I have enough space to store both formats: When a link breaks, I'll either serve MHTML (faster, more faithful) or the multi-file archives (more compatible) depending on the current state of support. 

# This site itself:

This blog uses an [(almost) zero-dependency site generator](/misc/new_ssg/): The only thing it needs is a C compiler. 

_When it does break, all the previously generated HTML can be served as-is_ : It's only used to update the site. 

All the blog posts have URLs beginning with /projects, /misc, /tutorials or /astro: If I reorganize things, it won't take up a lot of namespace to keep the old URLs working.
