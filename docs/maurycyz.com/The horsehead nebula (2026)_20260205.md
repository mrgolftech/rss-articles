# _The horsehead nebula (2026)_

**2026-01-09** ([Astronomical Images](/tags/astro/)) 

[![](/astro/horsehead/horse_small.jpg)](/astro/horsehead/horse_full.png) 0.55 arcseconds/pixel. Image is 27' wide. North is right (mirrored).

  * Color: 27 minutes (319 * 4 seconds) through thin clouds 
  * Equipment: C9.25, 0.63 reducer, ASI533 MC (IMX533 sensor), EQ6-R mount. 
  * Resolution: 5 arcsec FWHM 


I just can't seem to take a good picture of this region. This one has: 

  * Messed up backfocus and collimation 
  * Bad seeing, made worse by looking over the roof of my house 
  * Every *single* 5-second frame was ruined by clouds. 
  * I coudn't see Polaris so mount alignment was done based on memory 


This was the best night I've had all month: There was one moment where I could actually see Orion in the sky... at least it's better then my [last attempt](/astro/b33/) where I cound't even find the object. 

This is a heavly noise reduced version:

It looks a little better, but is missing a lot of the details of this object.
