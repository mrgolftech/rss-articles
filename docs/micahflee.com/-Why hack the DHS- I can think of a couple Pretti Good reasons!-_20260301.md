The hacker group, Department of Peace, published a statement that included:</p><blockquote>Why hack the DHS? I can think of a couple Pretti Good reasons! I&apos;m releasing this because the DHS is killing us and people deserve to know which companies support them and what they&apos;re working on.</blockquote><p>ICE agents recently murdered both Alex Pretti and Ren&#xe9;e Good in Minneapolis. The Trump administration is engaged in a conspiracy to protect the murderers, who remain free.</p><p>You can find the <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.org/ICE%20Contracts/" rel="noreferrer">raw data</a> on the DDoSecrets data server. It&apos;s two files, <code>dhs_contractors.json</code> (13.4mb) and <code>dhs_contracts.json</code> (3.6mb).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="bluesky-embed"><p lang="en">I just threw together a website visualizing this ICE contract data! You can browse through the companies and their contracts, and filter them by state micahflee.github.io/ice-contracts/</p>&#x2014; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uzucgmkg2y5vbkqnbv2on7g3?ref_src=embed">Micah Lee (@micahflee.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uzucgmkg2y5vbkqnbv2on7g3/post/3mfzmbmreec2r?ref_src=embed">2026-03-01T20:46:06.109Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>I downloaded it and wanted to see what contractors are in California. But huge JSON files are annoying to search, so I made a little static website called <a href="https://micahflee.github.io/ice-contracts/" rel="noreferrer">DHS Contracts Explorer</a> to more easily visualize it.</p><p>I haven&apos;t spent a lot of time yet looking at actual data, but I wanted to point out the first thing I noticed. The <a href="https://micahflee.github.io/ice-contracts/?modalType=contract&amp;modalAwardId=32" rel="noreferrer">largest contract</a> in the data is for $70,000,000! Seventy Million Dollars. It&apos;s for a company called Cyber Apex Solutions, LLC.</p><p>The contract was awarded March 31, 2017 (the beginning of Trump&apos;s first term) and ended March 31, 2022. If you look at the <a href="https://micahflee.github.io/ice-contracts/?modalType=company&amp;modalCompany=cyberapexsolutionsllc" rel="noreferrer">company details</a>, the contact is Cyber Apex Solutions CEO Justin AW Taft, with the email address jaw_t@hotmail.com. Yes, he is using his Hotmail account for this.</p><p>Any company that enters into a contract with ICE, especially during Trump&apos;s second term, is morally bankrupt and in a just would would be driven out of business. I hope this data, at the very least, contributes to local pressure campaign&apos;s against DHS contractors and convinces them to drop their contracts.</p>'}
