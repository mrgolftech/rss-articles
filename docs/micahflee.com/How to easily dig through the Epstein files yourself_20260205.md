# How to easily dig through the Epstein files yourself

![How to easily dig through the Epstein files yourself](/content/images/size/w1200/2025/11/bafkreia2s777q6d2pybal3kvkyf7y2vfht3uquskgdlezmepet75gbvinm.jpg)

Today, I published my first article in [Zeteo](https://zeteo.com/), alongside the amazing journalist Prem Thakker: [Zeteo Scoured 26,000 Epstein Docs. Here’s What We Found](https://zeteo.com/p/epstein-26000-emails-read-search-trump-summers-thiel). The latest Epstein dataset that the House Oversight Committee released is bonkers. It shows absolute elite impunity, and it implicates rich assholes like Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and Larry Summers.

From the article:

> Dinners with Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon. Friendly chats with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the _New York Times_. Trump, Trump, Trump. And so much more. **Zeteo  **scoured the 26,000 documents in a newly-released trove of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The emails range from shocking to absurd.

The full article is behind Zeteo's paywall. If you're not a paid subscriber, I recommend subscribing!

As part of this release, we also published a [searchable version](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=2283eeed70befac7) of the dataset using Google Pinpoint, a Google product for journalists. Pinpoint is nice and easy to use. It lets you index large folders of documents that are in Google Drive – this Epstein dataset is about 40GB – and it makes them searchable. It also does entity extraction, allowing you to easily filter by names of people and organization, and by locations and timestamps.

💡

[Google Pinpoint](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/about/) is Google product. Only use Pinpoint for datasets when you don't mind sharing a copy of your data with Google. It's great for completely public documents like these, but I recommend against using it for private data. Instead, use a tool like Aleph for that.

If you're interested in searching the latest Epstein files yourself, [give it a shot](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=2283eeed70befac7).

For example, you can [search for "dog that hasn't barked"](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=2283eeed70befac7&q=%22dog%20that%20hasn%27t%20barked%22&p=1) to find an [email](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/document-view?collection=2283eeed70befac7&p=1&docid=6c009504ac0caa9a_2283eeed70befac7_0&dapvm=2) from Jeffrey Epstein to Ghislane Maxwell, where Epstein tells her that Trump spent hours at his house with one of his sex trafficking victims:

> i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. virignia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.

You can also choose multiple filters as once, and combine them with search terms. For example, you can filter by "Jeffrey Epstein" to see everything that mentions him. Then you _add_ the filter "Steven Bannon" to see everything that mentions _them both_. [Here are](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/search?collection=2283eeed70befac7&p=1&docid=6c009504ac0caa9a_2283eeed70befac7_0&page=1&entities=%2Fm%2F0fz196%2C%2Fm%2F0bqscsg) the 79 documents that mention both Epstein and Bannon, and here's [one of them](https://journaliststudio.google.com/pinpoint/document-view?collection=2283eeed70befac7&p=1&docid=5e28ac6336527fe1_2283eeed70befac7_0&page=1&dapvm=2) where Epstein, Bannon, and the gross journalist Michael Wolff take time out of their day to talk shit about Ta-Nehisi Coates.

> Michael Wolff, Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein taking time out of their day covering up the world's most famous pedophile ring to complain about Ta-Nehesi Coates.
