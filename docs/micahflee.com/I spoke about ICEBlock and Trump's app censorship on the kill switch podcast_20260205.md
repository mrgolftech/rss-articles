# I spoke about ICEBlock and Trump's app censorship on the kill switch podcast

![I spoke about ICEBlock and Trump's app censorship on the kill switch podcast](/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzZlMDAwOGQ4LTYyMjYtNGEwNy04MjMyLWFlMmUwMTU0NzE4OS9lM2RlZDk0NS00ZGI4LTQxY2QtYWVkYS1hZTJlMDE1NDcxOTcvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTc0NjU2NzU2MCZzaXplPUx-1.webp) Logo for the [kill switch](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-kill-switch-30880104/) podcast

In case you missed it, last week I was on an [episode of the kill switch](https://omny.fm/shows/killswitch/iceblock-mightve-been-activism-theater-but-did-it-deserve-to-get-banned) podcast. I discussed the ICEBlock app and why it was [activism theater](https://micahflee.com/unfortunately-the-iceblock-app-is-activism-theater/), and how the developer handled my vulnerability report in the [worst possible way](https://micahflee.com/iceblock-handled-my-vulnerability-report-in-the-worst-possible-way/).

But I also talk about why, even though I have criticisms of ICEBlock, the Trump administration's censorship of the app stores (and Apple and Google's complicity) is _so incredibly bad_ , and _of course_ ICEBlock should still be available in the App Store.

Code is speech. The Trump administration pressuring Apple and Google to censor their app stores is a violation of the First Amendment.

Listen to the episode [here](https://omny.fm/shows/killswitch/iceblock-mightve-been-activism-theater-but-did-it-deserve-to-get-banned), or in [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maybe-iceblock-was-activism-theater-but-is-banning/id1449757372?i=1000732939606), or other places you listen to podcasts.
