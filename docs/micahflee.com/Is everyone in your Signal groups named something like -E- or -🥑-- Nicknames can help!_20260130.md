In Minneapolis, people are using hyper-local Signal groups for their buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and schools.</p><p>If you, like me, are in a ton of newly created Signal groups full people you don&apos;t know, or just met for the first time, keeping track of who is saying what might be super confusing.</p><p>Signal has a feature called <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007319011-Manage-Contacts-Nicknames-and-Notes" rel="noreferrer">nicknames</a> that can help. If you know that your friend Laura used to go by &quot;Mmm &#x1f32e;&quot; on Signal but recently changed her name to simply &quot;&#x1f951;&quot;, you can click on the &#x1f951; contact and set her nickname to &quot;Laura&quot; instead. From now on, you&apos;ll just see her as Laura, and your Signal groups will be slightly less confusing.</p><p>To set a nickname, go to a Signal group and click on the avatar of one of your contacts. It will pop up a menu like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img alt="Is everyone in your Signal groups named something like &quot;E&quot; or &quot;&#x1F951;&quot;? Nicknames can help!" class="kg-image" height="609" src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2026/01/signal-contact-1.jpg" width="736" /><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you tap a contact&apos;s avatar, you can click Nickname to set a nickname for them</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tap <strong>Nickname</strong>. You can set the name that you want to know this person as, and you can also add a note about this contact if you want. Nicknames and notes are stored end-to-end encrypted only for you. No one else can see what nicknames you&apos;ve set.</p><p>From this point on, once you set &#x1f951;&apos;s nickname to Laura, you&apos;ll just see her as Laura. If you mention her in the chat using &quot;@Laura&quot;, others in the chat will see you posting &quot;@&#x1f951;&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s it. Now people can use whatever crazy names they want, and change them as frequently as they want, and you no longer need to be confused.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-even-necessary-infiltrators">Why is this even necessary? Infiltrators.</h2><p>Signal is a usable, secure, encrypted messaging app. The tech is solid. That said, there are still two ways that Signal groups get compromised:</p><ul><li><strong>Someone&apos;s device gets searched.</strong> This typically happens after they get arrested, or searched at a border crossing or other security checkpoint, or their home or office is raided. See <a href="https://micahflee.com/practical-defenses-against-technofascism/" rel="noreferrer">Practical Defenses Against Technofascism</a> for some advise on dealing with this.</li><li><strong>Or an infiltrator joins the group.</strong></li></ul><p>Infiltrators join groups with lax permissions. Or, uh, maybe <a href="https://micahflee.com/we-are-currently-clean-on-opsec-the-signalgate-saga/" rel="noreferrer">Trump&apos;s national security advisor just adds them</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re not familiar with how Signal group links and permissions work, check out <a href="https://micahflee.com/using-signal-groups-for-activism/" rel="noreferrer">Using Signal groups for activism</a>. Some groups have group links on and anyone with the link can join. Others might allow anyone in the group to invite anyone else.</p><p>With large groups &#x2013; a requirement for mass movements &#x2013; group permissions like these make it easy for new people to get involved. But at the same time, they also make it a lot easier for infiltrators to snake their way in.</p><p>Because of the risk of infiltrators, it&apos;s common &#x2013; and in many cases a good idea &#x2013; to not put your real name in your Signal profile.</p><p>If a single infiltrator sneaks in, they&apos;ll get access to a list of everyone in the group. It&apos;s much harder for a MAGA chud to dox and harass you, or for the government to investigate you, if they only know you as &quot;&#x1f951;&quot;, without knowing your real name.</p><div class="kg-card kg-signup-card kg-width-regular " style="background-color: #F0F0F0; display: none;">\n            \n            <div class="kg-signup-card-content">\n                \n                <div class="kg-signup-card-text ">\n                    <h2 class="kg-signup-card-heading" style="color: #000000;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sign up for micahflee</span></h2>\n                    <p class="kg-signup-card-subheading" style="color: #000000;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hi, I&apos;m Micah.
