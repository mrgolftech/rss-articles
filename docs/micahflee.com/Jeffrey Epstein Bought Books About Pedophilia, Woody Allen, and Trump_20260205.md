This is a repost of an article I [originally published](https://zeteo.com/p/epstein-kindle-books-pedophilia-lolita-trump) on Zeteo. Following Zeteo's lead, this post is behind a paywall. You can read the full post (and support my work!) by becoming a paid subscriber.  
  
This journalism is only possible because of the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets. [Support their work](https://donorbox.org/ddosecrets).

**Zeteo**  can exclusively report that the Kindle library of notorious child rapist and former friend of Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, reveals his intense focus on Trump’s scandals, his study of how the wealthy hide money and avoid prosecution for their crimes, and his disturbing reading choices about sex crimes against minors.

Journalists are currently scouring over a [new batch of Epstein emails](https://ddosecrets.com/article/epstein-emails), apparently hacked from his personal Yahoo email address and provided to the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets. This collection of nearly 19,000 unredacted emails – not to be confused with the Epstein emails that the House Oversight Committee [recently released](https://zeteo.com/p/epstein-26000-emails-read-search-trump-summers-thiel) – spans from 2002 until well after his death in 2019, and contains everything from Alan Dershowitz helping him cover up child sex abuse to spam from a website where he apparently bought glasses once.

The trove also contains order confirmation emails from the Amazon Kindle store for about 150 books, as well as a few from Audible, and some movies and TV shows from Amazon Video. For example, on May 24, 2019 – just over a month before his July 6 arrest on federal charges for sex trafficking of minors – he purchased _The Annotated Lolita: Revised and Updated_ , by Vladimir Nabokov. He also bought the audiobook of _Lolita_  on Audible the same day. _Lolita_  is a 1955 novel about a pedophile who sexually abuses a 12-year-old girl after becoming her stepfather.

Epstein died in jail on August 10, 2019, after his second arrest. The disgraced financier was previously convicted of sex crimes in 2008. Congress recently passed legislation ordering the Trump Justice Department to release all of its files on him.

Below is a complete list of Jeffrey Epstein’s Kindle library, roughly organized by topic.
