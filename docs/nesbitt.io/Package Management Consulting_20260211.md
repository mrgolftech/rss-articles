If you’re building or running a package manager, registry, or dependency tooling, I can probably help.</p>\n\n<p>Over fifteen years I’ve built <a href="https://libraries.io">Libraries.io</a>, <a href="https://ecosyste.ms">Ecosyste.ms</a>, <a href="https://github.com/andrew/git-pkgs">git-pkgs</a>, the <a href="https://manifest.fm">Manifest podcast</a>, co-organised the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/package-management/">Package Management devroom at FOSDEM</a>, and contributed to <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. I’ve written integrations for dozens of package managers, tracked billions of dependency relationships, and watched the same design mistakes repeat across ecosystems for a decade. That pattern recognition is what I bring to consulting engagements.</p>\n\n<h2 id="what-i-can-help-with">What I can help with</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Package manager design &amp; architecture.</strong> If you’re building a package manager, registry, or dependency resolver, or trying to fix one, I can help you avoid the mistakes that RubyGems, npm, and PyPI learned the hard way. I’ve documented the design patterns, tradeoffs, and failure modes across dozens of ecosystems in my <a href="https://nesbitt.io/package-managers/">cross-ecosystem package manager documentation</a>. Namespace design, version constraint semantics, lockfile formats, registry APIs, lifecycle hooks, trust models.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software supply chain security.</strong> I’ve found and catalogued dependency confusion attacks, typosquatting campaigns, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting">slopsquatting</a> (a term I popularized), malicious maintainer takeovers, and protestware incidents across every major ecosystem. Trusted publishing, SBOM generation and enrichment, vulnerability scanning strategy. I know what actually works and what’s security theatre.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Package management governance.</strong> Registries aren’t just technical systems. They make political choices about naming, ownership, deletion, and dispute resolution. I contribute to <a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/">Alpha-Omega</a>, <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>, <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, and <a href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS</a> working groups. Whether you’re a registry operator designing policies, a foundation setting ecosystem standards, or a company navigating the governance landscape of your dependencies, I can help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open source ecosystem intelligence.</strong> Ecosyste.ms tracks 13+ million packages across 50+ registries, 290 million repositories, and 24 billion dependencies, the largest public dependency graph available. I can help you understand your dependency landscape, identify critical infrastructure in your supply chain, or build tooling on top of this data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Internal dependency strategy.</strong> For enterprise teams: audit your dependency practices, evaluate package manager choices, design internal registry architecture, set procurement policies, or build a supply chain security programme from scratch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open source strategy.</strong> I’ve <a href="https://github.com/andrew">built and maintained</a> open source for over fifteen years: <a href="https://octobox.io">octobox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass">node-sass</a>, <a href="https://24pullrequests.com">24 Pull Requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/splitrb/split">Split</a>, and contributions to <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. I’ve designed web applications that scale to millions of users. If you’re launching projects, building contributor communities, or making sustainability decisions, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Research &amp; analysis.</strong> Guest lectures, technical reports, ecosystem comparisons, landscape surveys. I’ve presented at <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/">NYU Secure Systems Lab</a>, spoken at the <a href="https://nesbitt.io/posts/">Software Mentions in OpenAlex workshop</a>, and contributed to research with <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a>, <a href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS</a>, and <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>\n\n<p>Typically an initial call to understand what you’re dealing with, then either a short engagement (a few days of focused work) or ongoing advisory. I’m flexible on structure.</p>\n\n<p>I’m based in the UK and work remotely. I’ve worked at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://tidelift.com">Tidelift</a>. Past clients include package registry operators, open source foundations (CHAOSS, OpenSSF), enterprise platform teams, and academic research groups (NYU, Software Heritage).</p>\n\n<p>Get in touch at <a href="mailto:andrew@nesbitt.io">andrew@nesbitt.io</a> or on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@andrewnez">Mastodon</a>.
