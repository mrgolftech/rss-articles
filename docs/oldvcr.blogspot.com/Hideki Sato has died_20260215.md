Hideki Sato remembered, because he was involved in or designed <em>all</em> of them &mdash; from the 1982 SG-1000 under Sega Enterprises Ltd. president Hayao Nakayama, later reworked <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/sg-1000-is-a-stupid-name-why-is-there-no-sg-500.html">as the SC-3000 home computer</a>, to of course the extremely popular Mega Drive/Genesis and the technologically overwrought Saturn, to the flawed but ahead-of-its-time 1999 <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/11/refurb-weekend-sega-dreamcast.html">Dreamcast</a>, the very last console the company released to date and one of my favourite machines. Joining Sega in 1971, he later became acting president from 2001 to 2003, and finally retired from Sega in 2008. I can think of no better summation of his career than <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">his own</a>, a detailed retrospective on each machine translated from the Japanese. He passed away <a href="https://x.com/beep2021/status/2022662105904877996">this weekend at the age of 77</a> (X.com link). Rest in peace.'}
