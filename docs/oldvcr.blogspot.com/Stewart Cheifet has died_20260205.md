###  Stewart Cheifet has died 

Very sorry to hear about [the death of Stewart Cheifet](https://obits.goldsteinsfuneral.com/stewart-cheifet) at 87, long-time host of Computer Chronicles, which for a long time was the undisputed best show on computers on American public broadcasting. I watched it on PBS TV as a kid, and candidly I didn't understand much of what was going on at the time, but I learned a lot and rewatching the episodes now really demonstrates what a treasure trove of pithy information and industry commentary they were. Gary Kildall, of Digital Research fame, was his co-host in many 1980s episodes and the most notable of an august crew that also included George Morrow and Paul Schindler, but Cheifet was the linchpin and carried the show on his formidable shoulders from its 1984 start until the final episode in 2002. The most amazing part of his work, however, is what happened after: the vast majority of the program is [preserved for posterity at the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Computer_Chronicles), not just with his blessing, but with his active participation. For any computer historian and student of the early industry, the show is not to be missed. Rest in peace.

## Welcome to Old VCR

My general vintage computing projects, mostly microcomputers, 6502, PalmOS, 68K/Power Mac and Unix workstations, but that's not all you'll see. While over the decades I've written for publications like _COMPUTE_ , _TidBITS_ and _Ars Technica_ , these articles are all original and just for you. My promise: No AI-generated article text, ever. All em-dashes are intentional and inserted _by hand_. Be kind, REWIND and PLAY. _\-- Cameron Kaiser_  
  
Old VCR is advertisement- and donation-funded, and what I get goes to maintaining the hardware here at Floodgap. I don't drink coffee, but the Mr Pibb doesn't buy itself. :-) Thanks for reading.
