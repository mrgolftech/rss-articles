The biodiversity of pop culture is really, really in danger. I didn\'t see it coming until a few years ago, but looking back it\'s very apparent.</p>\n<p>  I watched a sort of primitive form of the recommodification machine around my friends and myself in the sixties, and it took about two years for this clumsy mechanism to get and try to sell us The Monkees.</p>\n<p>  In 1977, it took about eight months for a slightly faster more refined mechanism to put punk in the window of Holt Renfrew. It\'s gotten faster ever since. The scene in Seattle that Nirvana came from: as soon as it had a label, it was on the runways of Paris.</p>\n<p>  There\'s no grace period, so that\'s a way in which I see us losing the interstitial.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This may seem like an odd thing to think about, but nearly all the art and culture that means something to me started as something that was transgressive and weird, and even if it was eventually metabolized by the mainstream, that was only after it had a chance to ferment and mutate in a tide-pool of Bohemian weirdness.</p>\n<p>All this century, I\'ve asked friends and weirdos about what can resist this commodification and co-option. Scott Westerfeld &#8211; author of <em>Uglies</em> &#8211; had a very on-brand answer: he told me that he thought that teenagers might deliberately start cultivating acne as a badge of rebellion. That hasn\'t happened yet, but if it does, it will be born co-opted, because there\'s already a luxury brand called "Acne":</p>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_Studios">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_Studios</a></p>\n<p>One anti-commodification measure that\'s worked reasonably well over the years is to be <em>ugly</em>. Punk zines and early Myspace pages embraced an aesthetic that the existing cohort of trained designers available to work for would-be co-opters would rather break their fingers than imitate. Eventually, some punk zinesters and Myspacers <em>became</em> freelance designers and offered the aesthetic for sale, but after the "grace period" that Gibson was worried about in 1999. By contrast, after a brief period in which early AI image-gen snuck psychedelic fish-dogs into every output, AI became so mid and inoffensive that even when it was used to make transgressive images (Trump spraying protesters with liquid shit from an airplane), it looked incredibly, terminally <em>normal</em>:</p>\n<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/20/ransom-note-force-field/#antilibraries">https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/20/ransom-note-force-field/#antilibraries</a></p>\n<p>There\'s more than one way to be ugly, of course. The "edgelords" that defined forums like SomethingAwful and /b/ made heavy use of slurs, rape "jokes" and other beyond-the-pale rhetoric. Whether this reflected sincerely felt beliefs or a mere desire to shock (or both), it had the effect of making these subcultures very difficult to commodify. If you and your friends barely utter a single sentence that can be quoted in a mainstream news forum or office email, it\'s going to be very hard to co-opt you. For a long time, edgelords festered in the "dark corners" of the internet. But that\'s changed. The Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes &#8211; who thinks that "every woman and girl" should be "sent to a gulag" &#8211; has had dinner at the White House:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nick-fuentes-women-gulag/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nick-fuentes-women-gulag/</a></p>\n<p>Last week, Ryan Broderick wrote a short, striking article for his must-read Garbage Day newsletter about the way that the far right have become "cool" within Gen Z by being so outre that they were evicted from the major platforms (before Trump II, that is):</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement">https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement</a></p>\n<p>As Broderick writes, "cool" isn\'t just "trends" ("hyperpop, brainrot, crowdwork comedy, Instagram collages, their weird post-COVID pop punk exploration"). For Broderick, cool things used to become trends <em>after</em> they were "begrudgingly canonized" by the likes of <em>Time Magazine</em>. But with Hollywood replaced by Youtube, magazines replaced by Tiktok, and radio replaced by Spotify, that looks very different today. Today\'s version of artist management teams is "hype houses." All forms of cultural activity have collapsed into a single, overriding imperative: "getting attention."</p>\n<p>Which brings Broderick to his main question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  If everything is just attention now, and attention is completely commodified by algorithmic tech platforms, how can you push back against that?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>His answer: "You have to essentially pre-deplatform yourself."</p>\n<p>For young people, "the only things that have the level of scarcity and danger required to be seen as cool" are "whatever is unacceptable on those platforms." In other words, anything (and maybe only things) that\'re blocked or banned are a candidate to be cool. Cool people walk away from the places where you\'d expect to find them and hang out in places that are culturally viewed as less important.</p>\n<p>Broderick argues that this is the source of far-right influencers\' influence: the fact that manosphere weirdos and trolls are hanging out in "shadowy corners" like Kick makes them feel authentic and outside of the norm and thus intrinsically interesting. And (Broderick continues) the fact that these manosphere types are now totally reliant on Discord clip-farmers has made them feel <em>more</em> mainstream and thus potentially less interesting.</p>\n<p>This is where it gets cool. Broderick argues that there\'s nothing intrinsically reactionary about this kind of self-deplatforming is a parallel evolution taking place in progressive media. When Stephen Colbert\'s Trump-colonized network bans him from airing an interview with a Democratic politician, he puts it on Youtube instead, where it gets far more attention than it would have if the network had just left him alone.</p>\n<p>But by and large it\'s not Democratic politicians who are too dangerous for the platforms &#8211; it\'s copyright infringement. The law makes it <em>very</em> easy to get things removed via unproven accusations of copyright infringement, and the platforms make it even easier:</p>\n<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never">https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never</a></p>\n<p>Copyright is a doctrine that, by design, has very fuzzy edges where things may or may not be prohibited. But in the digital world, those edges are often erased, even as the zone of lawful activity they enclose contracts. This means that media that can be <em>accused</em> of infringing copyright is the most unwelcome content on platforms.</p>\n<p>Broderick\'s theory predicts that the "coolest" media &#8211; the stuff that makes taste &#8211; is the stuff that fits in this zone of copyright infringement. He cites some compelling case studies, like Vera Drew\'s "The People\'s Joker," an amazing, unauthorized Batman mashup/trans allegory. Warner shut down multiple screenings of <em>The People\'s Joker</em> (including at TIFF), and this increased the coolness and prominence of the movie, driving people to underground screenings:</p>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Joker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Joker</a></p>\n<p>A more contemporary version is <em>Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie</em>, which Broderick describes as "a copyright rats nest" based on a web series that is "completely illegal to watch on streaming platforms":</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2026/02/14/hollywood/how-nirvanna-the-band-the-show-the-movie-skirted-copyright-law/">https://pagesix.com/2026/02/14/hollywood/how-nirvanna-the-band-the-show-the-movie-skirted-copyright-law/</a></p>\n<p>Despite this/because of this, <em>NTBTSTM</em> just had "the biggest opening ever for a live-action Canadian film":</p>\n<p><a href="https://x.com/hertzbarry/status/2023521583923663342">https://x.com/hertzbarry/status/2023521583923663342</a></p>\n<p>Broderick\'s conclusion is that "as platforms police speech less and less, edgelords lose their sheen," but that this material, at or beyond the edge of copyright, unwelcome on platforms, is the future face of cool.</p>\n<p>And here\'s where Broderick really got me: "the most dangerous thing for platforms is not racist garbage. It’s unmonetizeable content."</p>\n<p>I make a lot of "unmonetizable content," starting with this blog, which has no metrics, no analytics, and (of course) no ads. I refuse to add social media cards, and hide obscure jokes in incredibly long URLs that get truncated on social media. I labor for hours over the weird illustrations that go at the top of the posts, which I release (along with the text they accompany) under Creative Commons licenses that let pretty much anyone do pretty much anything with them, without asking me, telling me, or paying me (it\'s always very funny when someone accuses me of publishing this work as clickbait &#8211; clickbait for <em>what</em>? To increase bandwidth consumption at my server?).</p>\n<p>I do this to "woo the muse of the odd," a phrase I lifted from Bruce Sterling\'s 1991 keynote for the Game Developers\' Conference, a talk that struck me so hard that I dropped out of university to make weird multimedia shortly after reading it:</p>\n<p><a href="https://lib.ru/STERLINGB/story.txt">https://lib.ru/STERLINGB/story.txt</a></p>\n<p>It\'s a great talk, but the best parts are where Sterling grapples with this question of coolness, counterculture, and commodification:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, "woo the muse of the odd." A good science fiction story is not a "good story" with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good science fiction story is something that knows it is science fiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the other side. Computer entertainment should not be more like movies, it shouldn\'t be more like books, it should be more like computer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT THAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE!</p>\n<p>  I don\'t think you can last by meeting the contemporary public taste, the taste from the last quarterly report. I don\'t think you can last by following demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don\'t know many works of art that last that are condescending. I don\'t know many works of art that last that are deliberately stupid&#8230; Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird and don\'t do it halfway, put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\'s been more than 30 years since I read that essay, more than a quarter century since I asked William Gibson whether Madison Avenue "finds its own use for things." Over the ensuing decades, media has become ever-better at "following demographics and carefully meeting expectations," thanks to vast troves of behavioral data correlated with media analytics. That process has only accelerated the "recommodification machine" that Gibson worried about in 1999, but as Broderick points out, there\'s one thing that is even harder to co-op than acne &#8211; "unmonetizable content," the Kryptonite of the platforms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a name="linkdump"></a></p>\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a
