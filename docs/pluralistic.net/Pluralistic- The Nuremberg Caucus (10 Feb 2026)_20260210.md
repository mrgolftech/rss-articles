What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273</a></p>\n<p>That\'s table stakes. What would a <em>real</em> political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn\'t stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes:</p>\n<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345">https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345</a></p>\n<p>Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality:</p>\n<p><a href="https://archive.is/0LNh8">https://archive.is/0LNh8</a></p>\n<p>This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill:</p>\n<p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis">https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis</a></p>\n<p>The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance\'s assurances suggests ways that Dems could "meet the moment."</p>\n<p>I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader:</p>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials</a></p>\n<p>What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence.</p>\n<p>The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list.</p>\n<p>The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE\'s $75b budget to pursue Trump\'s crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work.</p>\n<p>While they\'re at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of <em>IRS</em> agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE\'s budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That\'s peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers.</p>\n<p>Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a "peaceful transfer of power" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election.</p>\n<p>But this bunch have already <em>repeatedly</em> signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html">https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html</a></p>\n<p>ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states ("The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue"):</p>\n<p><a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/">https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/</a></p>\n<p>The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are <em>begging</em> for leadership. They want an electoral <em>choice</em>, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will <em>mean</em> something.</p>\n<p>Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children">https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children</a></p>\n<p>But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html</a></p>\n<p>The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin. Dems need to stop demoralizing their base by doing nothing and start demonstrating that they understand the urgency of this crisis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a name="linkdump"></a></p>\n<h1>Hey look at this
