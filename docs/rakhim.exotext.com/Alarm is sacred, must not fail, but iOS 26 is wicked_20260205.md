# Alarm is sacred, must not fail, but iOS 26 is wicked

17 November 2025

There are two smartphone features that I consider sacred and believe they must never fail: phone calling and the alarm. There is an unspoken contract between users and vendors. Sure, innovate away, change the UX at will, whatever. But you can't fail at making phone calls and sounding the alarm. 

I missed the alarm for the first time in many years last weekend. I have an iPhone 13 Pro, with the latest iOS. There was no sound. When I woke up, the phone was still in "alarm mode", with the screen active, silently alarming nobody for 45 minutes. The snooze and stop buttons weren't responsive. I had to force quit the clock app.

I'm getting a quartz clock alarm I guess.
