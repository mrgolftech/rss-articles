<p>This is an excellent video about modern UI/UX: &quot;The Hidden Cost of 'Clean' Design.&quot; I highly recommend watching it and checking out Ilia's other work.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I agree with nearly everything in the video, including this standout quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to understand a generation, don't listen to what its witnesses say. Look at what it creates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ilia compares Apple Music and Winamp. One is modern and &quot;clean&quot;, the other feels &quot;dated&quot; to many people. Why does it feel dated? Because it has character. A distinctive style. It is <strong>visible</strong>. And modern interfaces are so devoid of character and look the same across companies and industries because designers tend to think that good UI should be invisible.</p>

<p>This is where I disagree with... well, I’m not sure if it’s Ilia or the general sentiment. Do UX designers today <em>really</em> think their interfaces are invisible?</p>
<p>I mean yeah, technically many of them are invisible in a literal sense: transparency and the lack of contrast dialed up to a fault. But I don't think this is what they mean. They mean &quot;invisible&quot; in the sense that you don't see the app; instead, you &quot;experience joy&quot; with music, &quot;get entertained&quot; by streaming, or &quot;relive memories&quot; through photos.</p>
<p>Winamp and other &quot;old-school&quot; programs possess prominent visual features that reflect the personality of their creators. You could argue that such a distinct character adds a visual layer that distracts from the media itself.</p>
<p>Yet, I find modern interfaces far more distracting. Not because of colors or shapes, but because in their pursuit of invisibility, designers have created unintuitive, multi-dimensional structures that we are forced to navigate. Structures with almost no connection to reality.</p>
<p>Winamp never made me feel stupid. Modern apps make me feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes. Instead of looking at a single screen with many colorful, high-contrast buttons and sliders, I'm flying through ephereal spaces connected with counter-intuitive links that lack consistent visual cues, with animations that do not represent the spatial structure at all. For example, some screens slide from the bottom as if there's a 3D-structure, but another screen would jump out of an icon and completely break that model in my mind. Animations and visual elements no longer represent a coherent model. It all feels like a dream. Structures are fluid and don't really build up into a clear model, ever. (This reminds me of LLM's lack of world model. Perhaps we're training ourselves to be more aligned with AI.)</p>
<p>So, on the surface it looks cleaner, but in my mind Apple Music is a lot more dirty, confusing, and disorienting. </p>
<p>Like an attractive sociopath.</p>
