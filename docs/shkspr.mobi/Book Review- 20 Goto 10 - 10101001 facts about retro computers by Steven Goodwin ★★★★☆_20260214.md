{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<img alt="Book Cover" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66673" height="309" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/20_GOTO_10_cover.webp" width="200" />\n\n<p>This is an excellent "dipping" book. There are nearly 200 articles ranging from short anecdotes, multi-page synopses of complex topics, and quirky little asides. Rather than a linear history of computing, each short chapter ends with a multiple-choice "GOTO".</p>\n\n<p>From there, you take a meandering wander throughout retro-computing lore.</p>\n\n<p>Some paths lead to dead-ends (a delightful little Game-Over experience) while others will send you round in loops (much like any text adventure). I\'ve no idea if I actually read everything - although I did stumble onto some Easter Eggs!</p>\n\n<p>Some of the knowledge in here is of the geeky arcane trivia which is of no use to man nor beast - yet strangely compelling to anyone who remembers POKE, CHAIN, and all the other esoteric commands. Some of the stories you\'ll undoubtedly heard before. Others are deliciously obscure.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the book is caught up in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/unbound-publishers-administration-authors-books-adhd-kat-brown-b2717886.html">continuing Unbound drama</a> so is rather hard to buy. There are <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/71656/20-GOTO-10-Book-by-Steven-Goodwin-(signed-by-author)/">signed copies available from The Centre for Computing History</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m grateful to the kind friend who lent me their copy.</p>'}
