This is a wryly funny and cosily charming book about council funerals.</p>\n\n<p>Evie King conducts Section 46 funerals under the Public Health Act. If you die and there\'s no one else around who is able to arrange your funeral, the local council steps in. This could be a coldly bureaucratic process with no wiggle room for anything other than perfunctory sympathy. But humans are going to human. Why <em>wouldn\'t</em> you put some effort in to making people feel cherished in death?</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, this is what Cameron\'s "Big Society" should have been about. Giving empathetic and passionate people a chance to serve their community and enrich all our lives. And, I guess, deaths. But austerity makes it hard to stay motivated when you\'re doing multiple people\'s jobs for a fraction of the pay.</p>\n\n<p>This isn\'t to say King is a whinger - quite the opposite - but she is clearly frustrated that she cannot do more. People who interact with the state are rarely in a good emotional or financial place. Those interacting with Section 46 deserve more support than is available to them. What King does is marvellous - but necessarily limited. In effect, it is a series of short stories each taking a look at a different death and how she tried as hard as possible to make the funeral process as painless and uplifting as it can be.</p>\n\n<p>The book is, naturally, a little upsetting in places. It isn\'t so much that people die; it is how society reacts which causes such emotional turmoil. Why are people sometimes abandoned? Why do reconciliations never happen until it is too late? How do we deal with trauma?</p>\n\n<p>It is an excellent book but it is rather annoying that the publisher, <a href="https://www.mirrorbooks.co.uk/">Mirror Books</a> only makes the eBook available via Amazon. There\'s no other way to read it - not even via a library! I resorted to borrowing the audiobook. This was the first audiobook I\'ve ever listened to - and it was a rather curious experience. The author\'s voice was slightly hesitant at first, but gradually became more passionate and evocative. It was wonderful to hear her tell her story directly.</p>'}
