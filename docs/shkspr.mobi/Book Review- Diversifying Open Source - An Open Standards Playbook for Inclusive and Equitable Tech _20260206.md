Too many books about the social problems with technology end up being a diagnosis with no cure.</p>\n\n<p>Paloma Oliveira\'s new book (with technical review by my friend <a href="https://fastwonder.com/">Dawn Foster</a>) is a deep dive into how we can all make Open Source more inclusive and equitable.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most tech books, it doesn\'t follow the usual pattern of restricting itself to the US hegemony. It is very focussed on the EU and the needs of people around the world. It is clear in identifying many of the problems which arise when people say they just want to focus on tech, not politics:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>When projects focus purely on technical excellence without considering accessibility, they create implicit barriers. Documentation written only in English, community discussions held during North American business hours, or development environments that require high-end hardware all reflect choices that determine who can participate—though these choices often remain unexamined.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is profoundly important. The book isn\'t afraid to be challenging. It links the way companies extract value from the commons to the way colonisers extracted value from the lands they "discovered".</p>\n\n<p>There are a few missteps which I didn\'t care for. While it starts as very casually written, it quickly finds itself getting into the weeds of political philosophy. I think that\'s a necessary evil. But I don\'t know how easily people will be convinced by passages like:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Bratton notes secessionist withdrawal in traditional territories and consolidation domains in stacked hemispheric, the continuing expansions of nebular sovereignties, and the reform of conventional States into regional platforms.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, there are a few "just-so" stories which are fictional parables. I think they would have been more convincing as actual case-studies.</p>\n\n<p>I did find myself skipping some of the background in order to get to the parts I found more interesting. The chapter on "Political Rhetoric and Institution Validation" felt a bit out of place and I didn\'t get much from it.</p>\n\n<p>But, after all that theory, there is a <em>lot</em> of practical advice. From how to structure your README to how to communicate change to your community. Even better, <a href="https://github.com/Apress/Diversifying-Open-Source">all the templates and resources are on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is thoroughly referenced and gave me lots of new rabbit-holes to follow Rather pleasingly, it cites my 2020 blog post "<a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/09/please-stop-inventing-new-software-licences/">Please Stop Inventing New Software Licences</a>" as an example of the ways in which corporates often try to stifle open source.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to help Open Source succeed, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy of this book.</p>'}
