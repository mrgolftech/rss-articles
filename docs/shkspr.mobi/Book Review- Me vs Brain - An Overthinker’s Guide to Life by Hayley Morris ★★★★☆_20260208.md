{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<img alt="Book cover." class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66658" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/9781804940327-jacket-large.webp" width="200" />\n\n<p>I bought this book for the title alone and I\'m glad I did! I don\'t think I\'ve seen any of Hayley Morris\'s comedy sketches. To be honest, you don\'t need to be a fan of her work to appreciate the humour and courage in this book. It could quite easily have been a cash-in celebrity autobiography - light on the details and full of charming anecdotes - and I\'m sure her fans would have snapped it up.</p>\n\n<p>Instead it is a darkly funny meditation on intrusive thoughts, panic, and acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>Her prose is exceptionally good - I loved the way she described doing the washing up as "giving a dinner plate a little bubble bath" - it\'s also extremely relatable. Everyone occasionally thinks "what if I just ran away?" or "what would happen if I dropped this glass?" For most people it is just a passing moment; but for Hayley it is something more intense.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is smuggled to the reader hidden within poop jokes, tales of teenage awkwardness, and millennial angst. It is consistently funny which makes the sudden switch to pathos all the more effective. It morphs into a tender tale of loss, loneliness, and something else beginning with L which will make me sound erudite.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn\'t describe it quite as a "self-help" book, but I think that\'s clearly part of the intention. Lots of people need to know that their (parasocial) friends find therapy useful. Having someone influential describe the journey to better mental health in such a relatable way will undoubtedly help others.</p>'}
