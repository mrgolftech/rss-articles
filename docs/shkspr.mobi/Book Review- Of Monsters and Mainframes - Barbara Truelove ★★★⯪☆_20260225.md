What would you do if your passengers were killed - not by a terrifying alien, but by Count Dracula???</p>\n\n<p>What if, on the return journey, another set of your passengers were similarly slaughtered. Except, this time, by a Werewolf? How would that make you feel? Would it drive you mad? Could you cope with the bullying from other starships? Or would you feel the need… the need for REVENGE!</p>\n\n<p>As I said, silly and campy fun. It is episodic adventure with just the right amount of Hammer-style horror and not too much technobabble. All the classic monsters are here - depression, intrusive thoughts, envy, fear.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and Frankenstein’s spider.</p>\n\n<p>As an ebook, it makes great use of fonts - which give it a delightfully retrofuturistic feel. There are some fun binary Easter-Eggs as well.</p>'}
