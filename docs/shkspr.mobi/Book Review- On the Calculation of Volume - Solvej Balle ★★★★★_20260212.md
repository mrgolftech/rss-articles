{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<img alt="Book cover." class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66803" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/On-the-Calculation-of-Volume-I-17-431x690-1.jpg" width="200" />\n\n<p>I had the <em>most</em> intense time reading this book. Do you ever see the date of a famous event and notice that it is also the date of your birthday? When I do, my brain gets a fun jolt of recognition. This book is set perennially on the 18th of November - my birthday. My poor little brain was exhausted and satiated from the repeated mentions. A most curious experience.</p>\n\n<p>It would be easy to dismiss this as "Groundhog Day" but French. Like the movie <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/09/movie-review-palm-springs/">Palm Springs</a>, it revitalises the "time loop" concept. Told through the diary of a woman trapped, we get an intimate sense of her claustrophobia and resentment.</p>\n\n<p>The novel is quiet and contemplative. Much like "<a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/02/book-review-in-search-of-lost-time-marcel-proust/">In Search of Lost Time</a>", it revels in describing the mundane. Although the prose is much more captivating than Proust! It meanders in lovely an unhurried way as our protagonist attempts to first understand and then make peace with her predicament.</p>\n\n<p>You could read it as a meditation on dementia - as her partner forgets every previous day. Or on divorce - as she attempts to hide in her own house. Perhaps it is an allegory for environmentalism as she tries to leave no mark on the world?</p>\n\n<p>I got to the end stunned by the journey - and I completely understand why it has attracted such a passionate following. That said, it was so intense that I\'m not sure I can handle reading the next six(!) in the series.</p>'}
