I\'ve thoroughly enjoyed all of
Janice Hallett\'s previous crime books
. The Examiner is, frankly, more of the same - and I\'m happy with that!
\n\n
You, the reader, are given a series of transcripts and have to work out what crime (if any) has been committed. You don\'t find out who the victim(s) is/are until reasonably far through the story. The characters are well realised (although a little similar to some of her others). The twists are shockingly good and will make you flick back to see if you could have spotted them.
\n\n
Hallett is
exquisite
at building tension through the slow drip-drip-drip of reveals. OK, so the transcripts are a bit unrealistic but they make a good scaffold. While it might be nice to include user avatars on the WhatsApp messages, the characters\' voices are unique enough to distinguish them easily.
\n\n
Much like
The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels
, the book plays around with symbolism and the nature of faith. You may find yourself sympathising with the characters and then quickly recanting!
\n\n
Technical Issues
\n\n
Viper, the publisher, seem to have messed up the structure of this eBook. Despite being published in 2024, they\'re using an
ancient
and obsolete version of the
Blitz ePub CSS
which itself was archived back in 2020. As well as strange indents, there\'s a hard-coded 2em margin only on the right.
\n\n
Accessibility is poor. All the abbreviations use the
<abbr>
element. But some kind of automated find-and-replace has mangled most of them. For example, the "Masters degree in Multimedia Art (Full-Time Programme)" is shortened to "MMAM(FTP)" and then given the nonsensical abbreviation of "Molecular Area Per Molecule (File Transfer Protocol)"!
\n\n
Much like before
I\'ve written to them asking them to correct it.
