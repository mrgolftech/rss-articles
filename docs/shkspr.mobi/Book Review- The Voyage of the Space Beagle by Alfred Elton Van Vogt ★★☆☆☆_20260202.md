This is Star Trek
before
Star Trek. It is Alien long before Alien. It is the template for so much modern science fiction. What it is
not
is particularly good.
\n\n
I don\'t intend to dump on the classics (and this is undoubtedly a classic) but 1950s sci-fi takes place in an almost alien media environment. Even if you ignore the anachronisms (
like having to develop film in order to see photographs
) and the archaic language (lots of vibrators being used against a big pussy) it is hard to get over how unconvincing it all is.
\n\n
In the first story, the crew of the Space Beagle find an alien monster. It probably killed one of them. They bring it aboard and just let it lounge about in the library! Yes, all the science is fun, and the "competency porn" of the professional crew is suitably heroic, but the characters and their motivations are frequently bizarre. It is only through the complete absence of girls (urgh!) that there\'s no interstellar sexism.
\n\n
The protagonist, Grosvenor, is a cipher for every geeky kid who ever felt he was smarter than everyone else. He is a sneering, taciturn, and deeply unpleasant character. When given the opportunity, he relishes the chance to become dictator.
\n\n
Because the book started life as a set of short stories, it works reasonably well as a "monster of the week" show. It is episodic, with well-placed cliffhangers. The science is
very
sciency with some excellent speculative elements. You\'ve got aliens planting eggs in people (like Alien) and a ship\'s engineer who says "Nooo! The walls couldn\'t stand it. They\'d melt." (like Scotty) and any number of concepts you\'ll recognise from your favourite TV shows.
\n\n
The obsession with hypnotism and mind-control feels a bit icky, especially when understood in association with the author\'s dalliance with the pseudoscience of Dianetics.
\n\n
The language (when not steeped in 1950\'s idiomatic phrasing) can verge on the poetic. Every story includes a chapter or two from the alien\'s viewpoint. They are deliciously weird and elevate this book beyond what might be a slightly forgettable slice of sci-fi.
\n\n
It is absolutely worth reading - if only to see how influential it has been - but it can be a bit of a weird slog at times.
