All set in book shops.</p>\n\n<p>Isn\'t it funny that some people don\'t know how books work! ROFL!</p>\n\n<p>Aren\'t the general public strange? LOLOL!</p>\n\n<p>That\'s a bit harsh of me. It only rarely becomes mean-spirited. But in a book this short, it rather contaminates the joy.</p>\n\n<p>That said, this one will live rent-free in my head for a while:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Did Beatrix Potter ever write a book about dinosaurs?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It\'s the sort of stocking-filler book which is reasonable for perusing on the loo. Light-hearted but ultimately disposable.</p>\n\n<p>Still, at least Neil Gaiman found it funny enough to leave a blurb…</p>'}
