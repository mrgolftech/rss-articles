{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>The good folks at Epomaker know that I love an ergonomic keyboard, so they\'ve sent me their new "Split 70" model to review.</p>\n\n<p>This isn\'t your traditional ergonomic keyboard. Essentially, this is two separate halves joined by a USB-C cable; so you can position it however you like.</p>\n\n<img alt="A keyboard split in two." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67791" height="388" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split70.webp" width="1024" />\n\n<p>Here\'s a quick video showing it in action:</p>\n\n<p></p><div class="wp-video" style="width: 620px;"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" controls="controls" height="349" id="video-67570-2" preload="metadata" width="620"><source src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4" /><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4">https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4</a></video></div><p></p>\n\n<p>It is <em>very</em> clicky! Yes, you can replace the keys and switches with something softer. But then people wouldn\'t know you\'re the sort of nerd who uses a mechanical keyboard. And where\'s the fun in that?!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the lights are delightfully dazzly. Yes, you can make them more subtle or even turn them off. But then people wouldn\'t know you\'re the sort of cool kid who has a light-up keyboard.</p>\n\n<h2 id="linux-compatibility"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#linux-compatibility">Linux Compatibility</a></h2>\n\n<p>The Split 70 comes with a USB-C to A cable. Personally, I\'d\'ve preferred straight C-C, but this does the job. Flick the switch at the back to USB mode, plug it in, and Linux instantly detected it. No drivers to configure.</p>\n\n<p>It shows up as <code>342d:e491 HS Epomaker Split 70</code> - there\'s another switch for changing between Mac and PC mode. That doesn\'t change how the keyboard presents itself; just the keycodes it sends.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s also a Bluetooth option. Again, Linux use was a breeze - although you\'ll have to remember what the pairing combo is and which device it is paired to.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s also a 2.4GHz option. Hidden on the back of the left unit is a little USB-A receiver. Again, pairing is simple - just plug it in and flick the switch.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, it also plays well with Android. The Bluetooth connection worked as did USB-OTG. Of course, quite <em>why</em> you\'d want a giant heavy keyboard paired to your tiny phone is an exercise left to the reader.</p>\n\n<h2 id="customisation"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#customisation">Customisation</a></h2>\n\n<p>This came as a US keyboard with the " and @ in the "wrong" place. It\'s easy to remap the keys and adjust the lights using <a href="https://usevia.app/">https://usevia.app/</a> - although you\'ll need to <a href="https://epomaker.com/blogs/via-json/epomaker-split70-json">download the JSON layout first</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It comes with a tool to remove the keys and switches. I\'ll admit, I\'m too much of a chicken to attempt that - but it does <em>look</em> easy.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>doesn\'t</em> look easy is the way to get it into firmware update mode - which involves shorting some pins and comes with some stringent warnings!</p>\n\n<img alt=" HOW TO ENTER DFU (FIRMWARE UPDATE) MODE Left Half (with knob): 1. Disconnect all cables from the keyboard. 2. Hold ESC and plug in USB-C. 3. &quot;Device Connected&quot; shows on the QMK Toolbox Right Half (with arrow keys): 1. Disconnect all cables from the keyboard. 2. Remove ALT and FN Keycaps and Flip the toggle switch between them down. 3. Remove Right Spacebar keycap and switch, short-circuit PCB holes with tweezers, then plug in USB-C.  4. &quot;Device Connected&quot; shows on the QMK Toolbox 5. After flashing, flip ALT/FN toggle back up. @ Please reset the keyboard after flashing is completed. *Notes: 1. When updating or flashing the keyboard, MAKE SURE ONLY ONE KEYBOARD IS CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE! 2. When updating or flashing the keyboard, DON\'T MOVE THE KEYBOARD or PRESS ANY KEYS!" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67792" height="1183" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/firmware.webp" width="1066" />\n\n<h2 id="gpl"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#gpl">GPL</a></h2>\n\n<p>There is some question about whether Epomaker comply with the GPL when it comes to the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/license_violations">QMK source</a>. They appear to have <a href="https://github.com/Epomaker?tab=repositories">some source code available</a> but it is hard to tell whether it exists for this specific model.</p>\n\n<p>After politely emailing them about GPL compliance, they were happy to supply <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Epomaker-Split70-QMK-File.zip">a link to the Split 70\'s QMK source code</a>. I\'m not deep into recompiling the firmware for my keyboards - but it looked comprehensive to me.</p>\n\n<h2 id="using-it"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#using-it">Using it</a></h2>\n\n<p>It\'s delightful to type on - and I got used to the noise after a while. I wasn\'t a massive fan of the layout to start with, but it easy to see its appeal. Personally, I\'d like an extra numpad to go with it.</p>\n\n<p>The four macro keys are useful. By default, they\'re set to cut, copy, paste, and undo - but can easily be remapped. The knob is fun - by default it does volume, I\'m sure you can find something else useful to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is excellent even if you have the lights on full disco. I kept it plugged in to my machine for typing most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to adjust the split to your own specification is outstanding. If you suffer from RSI, this can genuinely help.</p>\n\n<h2 id="price"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#price">Price</a></h2>\n\n<p>About £80 from <a href="https://amzn.to/3NMYqDr">Amazon UK</a> or <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3gTT3r9">AliExpress</a>. That feels <em>reasonable</em> for this much tech. Obviously you can get a bog-standard keyboard for buttons - but this is unique, tactile, and interesting.</p>'}
