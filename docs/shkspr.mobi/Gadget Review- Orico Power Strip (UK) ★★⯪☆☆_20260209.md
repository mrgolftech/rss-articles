On the surface, the specs are pretty good - two UK sockets, two USB-C for PowerDelivery, and two USB-A for legacy devices.</p>\n\n<img alt="Power Strip in black." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67535" height="1200" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PDC25.webp" width="1200" />\n\n<p>Let\'s put it though its paces!</p>\n\n<h2 id="specs"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#specs">Specs</a></h2>\n\n<p>Physically, it is a little larger than I was expecting. The two UK sockets are far enough apart to easily get your fingers around the plugs. Similarly, the USB ports are well-spaced. There\'s a tiny LED to show that power is connected, but it isn\'t offensively bright.</p>\n\n<p>The UK plug is <em>tiny</em>:</p>\n\n<img alt="Photo of a plug, the body is 1.3cm high." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67538" height="202" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/plug.webp" width="664" />\n\n<p>Even better, it comes with a proper fuse! The power cord isn\'t removable, but is long enough for most purposes.</p>\n\n<p>How much power can it supply? This is what the spec sheet says:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th align="right"></th>\n  <th align="center">V</th>\n  <th align="center">A</th>\n  <th align="center">W</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-A</td>\n  <td align="center">5</td>\n  <td align="center">3</td>\n  <td align="center">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-A</td>\n  <td align="center">9</td>\n  <td align="center">2.22</td>\n  <td align="center">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-A</td>\n  <td align="center">12</td>\n  <td align="center">1.67</td>\n  <td align="center">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-C</td>\n  <td align="center">5</td>\n  <td align="center">3</td>\n  <td align="center">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-C</td>\n  <td align="center">9</td>\n  <td align="center">2.77</td>\n  <td align="center">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td align="right">USB-C</td>\n  <td align="center">12</td>\n  <td align="center">2.08</td>\n  <td align="center">25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>But there is a fly in the ointment. While 25W is the most that a single USB-C port can output, the power drops once <em>multiple</em> devices are connected. If you have two or more plugged in, the total output is limited to a mere 15W. Not per-port; total!</p>\n\n<p>25W is already fairly low by PowerDelivery standards, so you won\'t be using this to power your gaming laptop while charging your tablet and headphones.</p>\n\n<h2 id="real-world-testing"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#real-world-testing">Real World Testing</a></h2>\n\n<img alt="Two plugs and two USB cables plugged into the unit." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67770" height="768" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/double-plug.webp" width="1024" />\n\n<p>I used my <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/gadget-review-plugable-usb-c-voltage-amperage-meter-240w/">Plugable USB-C Power Meter</a> with some high-quality USB cables. The Orico <em>mostly</em> lives up to its promises.</p>\n\n<p>When charging my laptop from either USB-C port, I was able to measure 22W (12V ⎓ 1.85A). Pretty close to the spec.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I plugged my phone into the other USB-C port, that dropped that down to just under 8W (4.8 ⎓ 1.65A) per port. Again, right on the promised 15W total.</p>\n\n<p>The USB-A port happily delivered 7.5W (5V ⎓ 1.5A) - much lower than expected. That dropped to around 5W (5V ⎓ 1A) once a USC-C load was connected. The C port was only delivering ~10W which wasn\'t enough to meaningfully charge the laptop.</p>\n\n<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-orico-power-strip-uk/#final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2>\n\n<p>The flat plug is handy for plugging this in to those hard-to-reach spaces. The cable is long enough for most uses. The mixture of ports isn\'t for everyone, but handy if you still have legacy devices you need to power.</p>\n\n<p>It meets the promised specification - but the specs are a bit of a let-down. You can get smaller devices which will do 60W charging from USB-C, and they\'ll spread that out over all their ports.</p>\n\n<p>The two UK sockets are a nice-to-have, but I can\'t help feeling that they\'ll mostly be used for adding additional chargers.</p>\n\n<p>It is cheap-ish - US$30 / £20 - and comes in a range of colours. If you need a long cable and don\'t need ultra-fast charging, this will do.</p>'}
