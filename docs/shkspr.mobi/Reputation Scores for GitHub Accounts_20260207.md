Even before Microsoft forced the unwanted Copilot assistant on millions of repos, it was always a gamble whether a new contributor would be helpful or just some witless jerk. Now it feels a million times worse.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/185387">some discussions about what tools repository owners should have to help them</a>. Disabling AI on repos is popular - but ignored by Microsoft. Being able to <em>delete</em> PRs is helpful - but still makes work for maintainers. Adding more AI to review new PRs and issues is undoubtedly popular with those who like seeing number-go-up - but of dubious use for everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to discuss something else - reputation scores.</p>\n\n<p>During Hacktoberfest, developers are encouraged to contribute to repositories in order to win a t-shirt. Naturally, this leads to some <em>very</em> low-effort contributions. If a contribution is crap, maintainers can apply a "Spam" label to it.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/">Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This works surprisingly well as a disincentive! Since that option was added, I had far fewer low-effort contributions. When I did apply the spam label, I got a few people asking how they could improve their contribution so the label could be removed.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is no easy way to see how many times a user has been labelled as a spammer. Looking at a user account, it isn\'t immediately obvious how trustworthy a user is. I can\'t see how many PRs they\'ve sent, how many have been merged or closed as useless, nor how many bug reports were helpful or closed as irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>some</em> badges, but I don\'t think they go far enough.</p>\n\n<img alt="A collection of little badges showing a GitHub user\'s achievements. " class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67688" height="360" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GitHub-Badges.webp" width="512" />\n\n<p>I think it <em>could</em> be useful if maintainers were able to set "contributor controls" on their repositories. An entirely optional way to tone down the amount of unhelpful contributions.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some example restrictions (and some reasons why they may not help):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Age of account. Only accounts older than X days, weeks, or years can contribute.\n\n<ul>\n<li>This disenfranchises new users who may have specifically signed up to report a bug or fix an issue.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Restrict PRs to people who have been assigned to an issue.\n\n<ul>\n<li>May be a disincentive to those wishing to contribute simple fixes.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Social labelling. Have other maintainers marked this user as a spammer?\n\n<ul>\n<li>Could be abused or used for bullying.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Synthetic Reputation Score. Restrict contributions to people with a "score" above a certain level.\n\n<ul>\n<li>How easy will it be to boost your score? What if you get accidentally penalised?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Escrow. Want to open a PR / Issue, put a quid in the jar. You\'ll forfeit it if you\'re out of line.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not great for people with limited funds, or who face an unfavourable exchange rate.  Rich arseholes won\'t care.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously, all of these are gameable to some extent. It also incentivises the theft or sale of "high reputation" accounts. Malicious admins could threaten to sanction a legitimate account.</p>\n\n<p>But apps like Telegram show me when someone has changed their name or photo (a good sign of a scammer). AirBnB &amp; Uber <em>attempt</em> to provide a rating for users. My telephone warns me if an unknown caller has been marked as spam.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t know which controls, if any, GitHub will settle on. There is a risk that systems like this could prohibit certain people from contributing - but the alternative is maintainers drowning in a sea of slop.</p>\n\n<p>I think all code-forges should adopt <em>optional</em> controls like this.</p>'}
