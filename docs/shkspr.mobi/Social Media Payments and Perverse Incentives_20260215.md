{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>At the recent "<a href="https://protocolsforpublishers.com/">Protocols for Publishers</a>" event, a group of us were talking about news paywalls, social media promotion, and the embarrassment of having to ask for money.</p>\n\n<p>What if, we said, you could tip a journalist directly on social media? Or reward your favourite creator without leaving the platform? Or just say thanks by buying someone a pint?</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s a trivial mock-up:</p>\n\n<img alt="Mock up of a Mastodon post. There\'s a a £ button next to boost. It offers the options to tip the suggested amount £0.15, or to tip a custom amount." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67671" height="541" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Tip-page.webp" width="998" />\n\n<p>Of course, this hides a ton of complexity. Does it show your local currency symbol? Does the platform take a cut or does it just pass you to the poster\'s preferred platform? Do users want to be able to tip as well as / instead of reposting and favouriting?</p>\n\n<p>But I think the real problem is the perverse incentives it creates. We already know that relentless A|B testing of monetisation strategies leads to homogeneity and outrage farming. Every YouTuber has the same style of promotional thumbnail. Rage-baiters on Twitter know what drives the algorithm and pump out unending slurry.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we ignore those who want to burn the world, content stealers like @CUTE_PUPP1E5 grab all the content they can and rip-off original creators. At the moment that\'s merely annoying, but monetisation means a strong incentive to steal content.</p>\n\n<p>When people inevitably get scammed, would that damage the social media platform? Would promoting a payment link lead to liability? Now that money is involved, does that make hacking more attractive?</p>\n\n<p>And yet… Accounts add payment links to their profiles all the time. Lots of accounts regularly ask for donor and sponsors. GitHub sponsors exist and I don\'t see evidence of people impersonating big projects and snaffling funds.</p>\n\n<p>It is somewhat common for platforms to pay for publishers to be on their site. If you\'re starting up a new service then you need to give people an incentive to be there. That might be as a payer or receiver.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I\'d love a frictionless way to throw a quid to a helpful blog post, or effortlessly donate to a poster who has made me laugh. Selfishly, I\'d like it if people paid me for my Open Source or (micro)blogging.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t know whether Mastodon or BlueSky will ever have a payments button - and I have no influence on their decision-making process - but I\'d sure like to see them experiement.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Edent/116023582888695517">read more discussion on Mastodon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or, feel free to send me a tip!</p>\n\n<ul id="review-list">\n<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/13GFCFR2B2IX4?type=wishlist&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=shksprblogwish-21"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=amazon.co.uk" width="20" />Buy me a gift from my Amazon wishlist</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/edent"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=github.com" width="20" />Sponsor me on GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://paypal.me/edent/gbp1"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=paypal.com" width="20" />Send me money via PayPal</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/edent"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=ko-fi.com" width="20" />Support me on Ko-Fi</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://patreon.com/edent"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=patreon.com" width="20" />Become a Patreon</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/edent"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=opencollective.com" width="20" />Join my Open Collective</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://liberapay.com/edent"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=liberapay.com" width="20" />Donate using LiberaPay</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wise.com/pay/me/terencee51"><img alt="" src="https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=wise.com" width="20" />Pay with Wise</a></li>\n</ul>'}
