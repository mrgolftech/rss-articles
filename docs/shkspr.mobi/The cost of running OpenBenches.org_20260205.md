#  [The cost of running OpenBenches.org](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/)

[fosdem](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/fosdem/) [foss](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/foss/) [money](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/money/) [OpenBenches](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/openbenches/) · [6 comments](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#comments) · 800 words · Viewed ~470 times

After my recent presentation at FOSDEM, someone asked a pretty reasonable question. What does it cost to run [OpenBenches](https://openbenches.org/)?

It is, thankfully, surprisingly cheap! In part, that's because it is a relatively simple tech stack - PHP, MySQL, a couple of API calls to external services. It was designed to be as low cost while also being useful. Here's the breakdown:

##  Hosting - £171 per year

Our biggest expense but, I think, our most reasonable. [Krystal](https://krystal.io/hosting) charges around £342 for a 2 year contract. That includes unlimited bandwidth and storage, as well as the domain name. We have nearly 400GB of photos and bot scraping means we can use over 900GB of bandwidth per month - so Krystal give us a rather good deal!

![Graph showing sudden spikes in data use as our bandwidth is consumed by bots.](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/April-Bandwidth.webp)

Use [this affiliate link and code `EDENT`](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?s=3990878&v=117205&q=524267&r=1062999) to get a small discount.

##  Stadia Maps - US$20 / month

Geocoding is surprisingly hard to do locally. We need to transform latitude and longitude into addresses, and then back again. [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/) cost about the same as our hosting! What's rather annoying is that we only use about half the API calls in our plan. We need to find a cheaper solution.

##  Mapping - Free!

When we used Stadia for drawing maps, we regularly ran over our quota. So we switched to [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) which produces gorgeous interactive maps.

The service has been rock solid and very responsive to bugs on GitHub.

##  Logo - US$5

I'm not a good designer, so we bought a [logo from The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/icon/park-923893/) and then coloured it in. Bargain for a fiver!

##  Image CDN - Free!

Although we have unlimited bandwidth with Krystal, we're only located in one region - the UK. [WeServ](https://images.weserv.nl/). It's also pointless serving full resolution images to small screens.

So WeServ offers free image resizing and global CDNs. Personally, I'm not a fan of CloudFlare (their CDN partner) so I'm looking to change provider.

##  OCR - Free!

People don't want to type in the inscription of the photo, so we use [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr).

We send less than 1,000 requests per month - [so we're inside their free tier](https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing). If we get more popular, that'll get more expensive. But I don't know of a local-first OCR which is as good as Google's. Sadly, Tesseract is rubbish for extracting text from photos.

##  Authentication - Free!

We don't want to store anyone's passwords. The [free tier of Auth0](https://auth0.com/pricing) allows us to do social login for up to 25,000 monthly users. Which is more than enough for us.

Sadly, Auth0 don't support the Fediverse, [so I had to build my own "Log-in with Mastodon" service](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/12/creating-a-generic-log-in-with-mastodon-service/).

As much as we'd like to run social login locally, we simply don't want to be responsible for securing users' details & API keys.

##  Software - Free!

As per [the OpenBenches colophon](https://www.openbenches.org/colophon) we use a lot of cool FOSS. Small JS libraries, big PHP frameworks, and everything in between.

##  Income

Thanks to [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/openbenches/) we make a whopping US$3 per month!

Similarly, our [OpenCollective Sponsors](https://opencollective.com/openbenches) brings in about £3 per month.

Merchandising! You can [buy OpenBenches branded t-shirts, mugs, and hats](https://openbenches.myspreadshop.co.uk/all). That nets us about £20 per year

Call it roughly £80 income. OK, it is better than nothing - but doesn't even cover a quarter of our costs. Sometimes people give us a higher donation privately, which is also very welcome. These people are [listed on our README](https://github.com/openbenches/openbenches.org?tab=readme-ov-file#supporters).

##  Total

On the assumption that our time is worthless (ha!) and that we only rarely go over our providers' API limits, and we get in _some_ revenue, the cost of running OpenBenches is less than £300 per year.

That's not bad for a fun little hobby. People certainly spend more than that on Funkopops, vaping, and mechanical keyboards!

Nevertheless, I'm always slightly worried that we'll go viral and have an unexpectedly high bill from our API providers.

I would love to be able to hire a proper designer to make the site look a bit nicer. I also want to be able to buy a modern iPhone so that I can test it in the latest Safari.

If you have any suggestions for cutting costs, or non-scummy ways to help us raise funds, please drop a comment below.

It's pretty cool that OpenBenches runs on such a low budget, especially with all those API calls and hosting costs. The use of FOSS tools is definitely a win too. Have you thought about any crowdfunding options or maybe a Patreon to cover those costs and fund some design upgrades?

I don’t know if the OpenBenches project would qualify, but there is an “free for open-source” tier that you could use on BrowserStack, to do some virtual testing on (amongst others) mobile-Safari…

See: <https://www.browserstack.com/open-source>

This weekend, I helped OpenBenches extend its reach to Tenerife, by finding and photographing a bench in the memorial garden for the Dan-Air Flight 1008 disaster. Almost-simultaneously, Terence Eden shared a blog post about the cost of running the OpenBenches service. Taken together, that feels like an excuse for me to plug the project (again)!
