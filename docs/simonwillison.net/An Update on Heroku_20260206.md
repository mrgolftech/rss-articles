<p><strong><a href="https://www.heroku.com/blog/an-update-on-heroku/">An Update on Heroku</a></strong></p>
An ominous headline to see on the official Heroku blog and yes, it's bad news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on context I'm guessing a "sustaining engineering model" (this definitely isn't a widely used industry term) means that they'll keep the lights on and that's it.</p>
<p>This is a very frustrating piece of corporate communication. "We want to be clear about what this means for customers" - then proceeds to <em>not be clear</em> about what this means for customers.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Here's their explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My blog is the only project I have left running on Heroku. I guess I'd better migrate it away (probably to Fly) before Salesforce lose interest completely.
