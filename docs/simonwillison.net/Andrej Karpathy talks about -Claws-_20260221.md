Andrej Karpathy tweeted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini ("The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused") to tinker with Claws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically [...] But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.</p>
<p>Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. [...]</p>
<p>Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). [...]</p>
<p>Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrej has an ear for fresh terminology (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/11/glm-5/">agentic engineering</a>) and I think he's right about this one, too: "<strong>Claw</strong>" is becoming a term of art for the entire category of OpenClaw-like agent systems - AI agents that generally run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols and can both act on direct instructions and schedule tasks.</p>
<p>It even comes with an established emoji 🦞
