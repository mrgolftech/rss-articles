<p>Someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47008560#47008978">asked</a> if there was an Anthropic equivalent to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/13/openai-mission-statement/">OpenAI's IRS mission statements over time</a>.</p>
<p>Anthropic are a "public benefit corporation" but not a non-profit, so they don't have the same requirements to file public documents with the IRS every year.</p>
<p>But when I asked Claude it ran a search and dug up this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ImqXYv9_H2FTNAujZfu3EPtYFD4xIlHJ">Google Drive folder</a> where Zach Stein-Perlman shared Certificate of Incorporation documents he <a href="https://ailabwatch.substack.com/p/anthropics-certificate-of-incorporation">obtained from the State of Delaware</a>!</p>
<p>Anthropic's are much less interesting that OpenAI's. The earliest document from 2021 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The specific public benefit that the Corporation will promote is to responsibly develop and maintain advanced Al for the cultural, social and technological improvement of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every subsequent document up to 2024 uses an updated version which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The specific public benefit that the Corporation will promote is to responsibly develop and maintain advanced AI for the long term benefit of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
