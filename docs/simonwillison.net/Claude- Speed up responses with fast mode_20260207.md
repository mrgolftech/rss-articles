<p><strong><a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode">Claude: Speed up responses with fast mode</a></strong></p>
New "research preview" from Anthropic today: you can now access a faster version of their frontier model Claude Opus 4.6 by typing <code>/fast</code> in Claude Code... but at a cost that's 6x the normal price.</p>
<p>Opus is usually $5/million input and $25/million output. The new fast mode is $30/million input and $150/million output!</p>
<p>There's a 50% discount until the end of February 16th, so only a 3x multiple (!) before then.</p>
<p>How much faster is it? The linked documentation doesn't say, but <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2020207322124132504">on Twitter</a> Claude say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our teams have been building with a 2.5x-faster version of Claude Opus 4.6.</p>
<p>We’re now making it available as an early experiment via Claude Code and our API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claude Opus 4.5 had a context limit of 200,000 tokens. 4.6 has an option to increase that to 1,000,000 at 2x the input price ($10/m) and 1.5x the output price ($37.50/m) once your input exceeds 200,000 tokens. These multiples hold for fast mode too, so after Feb 16th you'll be able to pay a hefty $60/m input and $225/m output for Anthropic's fastest best model.
