One of the sub-threads of the AI energy usage discourse has been the impact new data centers have on the cost of electricity to nearby residents. Here's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">detailed analysis from Bloomberg in September</a> reporting "Wholesale electricity costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers".</p>
<p>Anthropic appear to be taking on this aspect of the problem directly, promising to cover 100% of necessary grid upgrade costs and also saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will work to bring net-new power generation online to match our data centers’ electricity needs. Where new generation isn’t online, we’ll work with utilities and external experts to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects from our data centers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to genuine energy industry experts picking this apart to judge if it will actually have the claimed impact on consumers.</p>
<p>As always, I remain frustrated at the refusal of the major AI labs to fully quantify their energy usage. The best data we've had on this still comes from Mistral's report <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/mistral-environmental-standard/">last July</a> and even that lacked key data such as the breakdown between energy usage for training vs inference.
