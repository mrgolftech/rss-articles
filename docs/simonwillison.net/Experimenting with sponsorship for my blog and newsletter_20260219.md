<p>I've long been resistant to the idea of accepting sponsorship for my blog. I value my credibility as an independent voice, and I don't want to risk compromising that reputation.</p>
<p>Then I learned about Troy Hunt's <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/sponsorship/">approach to sponsorship</a>, which he first wrote about <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/im-now-offering-sponsorship-of-this-blog/">in 2016</a>. Troy runs with a simple text row in the page banner - no JavaScript, no cookies, unobtrusive while providing value to the sponsor. I can live with that!</p>
<p>Accepting sponsorship in this way helps me maintain my independence while offsetting the opportunity cost of not taking a full-time job.</p>
<p>To start with I'm selling sponsorship by the week. Sponsors get that unobtrusive banner across my blog and also their sponsored message at the top of <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of my blog's homepage. Below the Simon Willison's Weblog heading and list of tags is a new blue page-wide banner reading &quot;Sponsored by: Teleport - Secure, Govern, and Operate Al at Engineering Scale. Learn more&quot;." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/sponsor-banner.jpg" /></p>
<p>I <strong>will not write content in exchange for sponsorship</strong>. I hope the sponsors I work with understand that my credibility as an independent voice is a key reason I have an audience, and compromising that trust would be bad for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freemanandforrest.com/">Freeman &amp; Forrest</a> helped me set up and sell my first slots. Thanks also to <a href="https://t3.gg/">Theo Browne</a> for helping me think through my approach.</p>
