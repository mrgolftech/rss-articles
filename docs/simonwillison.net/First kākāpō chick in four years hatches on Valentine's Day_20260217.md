First chick of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#1-year-k-k-p-parrots-will-have-an-outstanding-breeding-season">the 2026 breeding season</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kākāpō Yasmine hatched an egg fostered from kākāpō Tīwhiri on Valentine's Day, bringing the total number of kākāpō to 237 – though it won’t be officially added to the population until it fledges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's why the egg was fostered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kākāpō mums typically have the best outcomes when raising a maximum of two chicks. Biological mum Tīwhiri has four fertile eggs this season already, while Yasmine, an experienced foster mum, had no fertile eggs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/digs.bsky.social/post/3mf25glzt2c2b">update from conservation biologist Andrew Digby</a> - a second chick hatched this morning!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second #kakapo chick of the #kakapo2026 breeding season hatched this morning: Hine Taumai-A1-2026 on Ako's nest on Te Kākahu. We transferred the egg from Anchor two nights ago. This is Ako's first-ever chick, which is just a few hours old in this video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/digs.bsky.social/post/3mf25glzt2c2b">has a video</a> of mother and chick.</p>
