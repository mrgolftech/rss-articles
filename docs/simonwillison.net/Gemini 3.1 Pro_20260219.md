<p><strong><a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/">Gemini 3.1 Pro</a></strong></p>
The first in the Gemini 3.1 series, priced the same as Gemini 3 Pro ($2/million input, $12/million output under 200,000 tokens, $4/$18 for 200,000 to 1,000,000). That's less than half the price of Claude Opus 4.6 with very similar benchmark scores to that model.</p>
<p>They boast about its improved SVG animation performance compared to Gemini 3 Pro in the announcement!</p>
<p>I tried "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle" <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221ugF9fBfLGxnNoe8_rLlluzo9NSPJDWuF%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22106366615678321494423%22,%22resourceKeys%22:%7B%7D%7D&amp;usp=sharing">in Google AI Studio</a> and it thought for 323.9 seconds (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/03a755865021739a3659943a22c125ba#thinking-trace">thinking trace here</a>) before producing this one:</p>
<p><img alt="Whimsical flat-style illustration of a pelican wearing a blue and white baseball cap, riding a red bicycle with yellow-rimmed wheels along a road. The pelican has a large orange bill and a green scarf. A small fish peeks out of a brown basket on the handlebars. The background features a light blue sky with a yellow sun, white clouds, and green hills." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3.1-pro-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>It's good to see the legs clearly depicted on both sides of the frame (should <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2023833496804839808">satisfy Elon</a>), the fish in the basket is a nice touch and I appreciated this comment in <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/03a755865021739a3659943a22c125ba#response">the SVG code</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Black Flight Feathers on Wing Tip --&gt;
&lt;path d="M 420 175 C 440 182, 460 187, 470 190 C 450 210, 430 208, 410 198 Z" fill="#374151" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/issues/121">added</a> the two new model IDs <code>gemini-3.1-pro-preview</code> and <code>gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools</code> to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini plugin</a> for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>. That "custom tools" one is <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-3.1-pro-preview#gemini-31-pro-preview-customtools">described here</a> - apparently it may provide better tool performance than the default model in some situations.</p>
<p>The model appears to be <em>incredibly</em> slow right now - it took 104s to respond to a simple "hi" and a few of my other tests met "Error: This model is currently experiencing high demand. Spikes in demand are usually temporary. Please try again later." or "Error: Deadline expired before operation could complete" errors. I'm assuming that's just teething problems on launch day.</p>
<p>It sounds like last week's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/12/gemini-3-deep-think/">Deep Think release</a> was our first exposure to the 3.1 family:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week, we released a major update to Gemini 3 Deep Think to solve modern challenges across science, research and engineering. Today, we’re releasing the upgraded core intelligence that makes those breakthroughs possible: Gemini 3.1 Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/nov/13/training-for-pelicans-riding-bicycles/">What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles?</a> last November I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a model finally comes out that produces an excellent SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle you can bet I’m going to test it on all manner of creatures riding all sorts of transportation devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google's Gemini Lead Jeff Dean <a href="https://x.com/JeffDean/status/2024525132266688757">tweeted this video</a> featuring an animated pelican riding a bicycle, plus a frog on a penny-farthing and a giraffe driving a tiny car and an ostrich on roller skates and a turtle kickflipping a skateboard and a dachshund driving a stretch limousine.</p>
<video controls="controls" poster="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-animated-pelicans.jpg" preload="none">
  <source src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-animated-pelicans.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>I've been saying for a while that I wish AI labs would highlight things that their new models can do that their older models could not, so top marks to the Gemini team for this video.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I used <code>llm-gemini</code> to run my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/#and-a-new-pelican-benchmark">more detailed Pelican prompt</a>, with <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a3bdd4ec9476ba9e9ba7aa61b46d8296">this result</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Flat-style illustration of a brown pelican riding a teal bicycle with dark blue-rimmed wheels against a plain white background. Unlike the previous image's white cartoon pelican, this pelican has realistic brown plumage with detailed feather patterns, a dark maroon head, yellow eye, and a large pink-tinged pouch bill. The bicycle is a simpler design without a basket, and the scene lacks the colorful background elements like the sun, clouds, road, hills, cap, and scarf from the first illustration, giving it a more minimalist feel." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3.1-pro-pelican-2.png" /></p>
<p>From the SVG comments:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Pouch Gradient (Breeding Plumage: Red to Olive/Green) --&gt;
...
&lt;!-- Neck Gradient (Breeding Plumage: Chestnut Nape, White/Yellow Front) --&gt;
</code></pre>
