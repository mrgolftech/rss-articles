<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6">Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.6</a></strong></p>
Sonnet 4.6 is out today, and Anthropic claim it offers similar performance to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/24/claude-opus/">November's Opus 4.5</a> while maintaining the Sonnet pricing of $3/million input and $15/million output tokens (the Opus models are $5/$25). Here's <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/78073f739564e986ff3e28522761a7a0b4484f84.pdf">the system card PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Sonnet 4.6 has a "reliable knowledge cutoff" of August 2025, compared to Opus 4.6's May 2025 and Haiku 4.5's February 2025. Both Opus and Sonnet default to 200,000 max input tokens but can stretch to 1 million in beta and at a higher cost.</p>
<p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.24">llm-anthropic 0.24</a> with support for both Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6. Claude Code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/65">did most of the work</a> - the new models had a fiddly amount of extra details around adaptive thinking and no longer supporting prefixes, as described <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide">in Anthropic's migration guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b185576a95e9321b441f0a4dfc0e297c">what I got</a> from:</p>
<pre><code>uvx --with llm-anthropic llm 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -m claude-sonnet-4.6
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="The pelican has a jaunty top hat with a red band. There is a string between the upper and lower beaks for some reason. The bicycle frame is warped in the wrong way." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/pelican-sonnet-4.6.png" /></p>
<p>The SVG comments include:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Hat (fun accessory) --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I tried a second time and also got a top hat. Sonnet 4.6 apparently loves top hats!</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the pelican Opus 4.5 drew me <a href="https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/(https:/simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/24/claude-opus/)">in November</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="The pelican is cute and looks pretty good. The bicycle is not great - the frame is wrong and the pelican is facing backwards when the handlebars appear to be forwards.There is also something that looks a bit like an egg on the handlebars." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-opus-4.5-pelican.jpg" /></p>
<p>And here's Anthropic's current best pelican, drawn by Opus 4.6 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/5/two-new-models/">on February 5th</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Slightly wonky bicycle frame but an excellent pelican, very clear beak and pouch, nice feathers." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/opus-4.6-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>Opus 4.6 produces the best pelican beak/pouch. I do think the top hat from Sonnet 4.6 is a nice touch though.
