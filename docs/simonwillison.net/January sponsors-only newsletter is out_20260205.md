I just sent the January edition of my [sponsors-only monthly newsletter](https://github.com/sponsors/simonw/). If you are a sponsor (or if you start a sponsorship now) you can [access it here](https://github.com/simonw-private/monthly/blob/main/2026-01-january.md). In the newsletter for January:

  * LLM predictions for 2026
  * Coding agents get even more attention
  * Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw went very viral
  * Kakapo breeding season is off to a really strong start
  * New options for sandboxes
  * Web browsers are the "hello world" of coding agent swarms
  * Sam Altman addressed the Jevons paradox for software engineering
  * Model releases and miscellaneous extras



Here's [a copy of the December newsletter](https://gist.github.com/simonw/13e595a236218afce002e9aeafd75cd0) as a preview of what you'll get. Pay $10/month to stay a month ahead of the free copy!
