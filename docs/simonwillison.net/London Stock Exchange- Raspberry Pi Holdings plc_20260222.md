<p>Users have turned to Raspberry Pi's small computers to run a technology known as OpenClaw, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/07/i-built-a-whatsapp-bot-and-now-it-runs-my-entire-life/">a viral AI personal assistant</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Shares in Raspberry Pi rose as much as 42% on Tuesday in ‌a record two‑day rally after CEO Eben Upton bought ‌stock in the beaten‑down UK computer hardware firm, halting a months‑long slide, ​as chatter grew that its products could benefit from low‑cost artificial‑intelligence projects.</p>
<p>Two London traders said the driver behind the surge was not clear, though the move followed a filing showing Upton bought ‌about 13,224 pounds ⁠worth of shares at around 282 pence each on Monday.</p>
