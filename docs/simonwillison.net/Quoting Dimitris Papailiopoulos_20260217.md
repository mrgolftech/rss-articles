Before this, the way I'd explore a new idea is to either clumsily put something together myself or ask a student to run something short for signal, and if it's there, we’d go deeper. That quick signal step, i.e., finding out if a question has any meat to it, is what I can now do without taking up anyone else's time. It’s now between just me, Claude Code, and a few days of GPU time.</p>
<p>I don’t know what this means for how we do research long term. I don’t think anyone does yet. But <strong>the distance between a question and a first answer just got very small</strong>.</p></blockquote>
