Mistral just released Voxtral Transcribe 2 - a family of two new models, one open weights, for transcribing audio to text. This is the latest in their Whisper-like model family, and a sequel to the original Voxtral which they released <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/16/voxtral/">in July 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Voxtral Realtime - official name <code>Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602</code> - is the open weights (Apache-2.0) model, available as a <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602">8.87GB download from Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p>You can try it out in this <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-Realtime">live demo</a> - don't be put off by the "No microphone found" message, clicking "Record" should have your browser request permission and then start the demo working. I was very impressed by the demo - I talked quickly and used jargon like Django and WebAssembly and it correctly transcribed my text within moments of me uttering each sound. </p>
<p>The closed weight model is called <code>voxtral-mini-latest</code> and can be accessed via the Mistral API, using calls that look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl -X POST <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>https://api.mistral.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -H <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Authorization: Bearer <span class="pl-smi">$MISTRAL_API_KEY</span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -F model=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>voxtral-mini-latest<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -F file=@<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Pelican talk at the library.m4a<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -F diarize=true \
  -F context_bias=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Datasette<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -F timestamp_granularities=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>segment<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>

<p>The Mistral API console now has a <a href="https://console.mistral.ai/build/audio/speech-to-text">speech-to-text playground</a> for exercising the new model and it is <em>excellent</em>. You can upload an audio file and promptly get a diarized transcript in a pleasant interface, with options to download the result in text, SRT or JSON format.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a speech-to-text transcription interface for a file named &quot;Pelican talk at the library.m4a&quot;. The toolbar shows &quot;Speech to text&quot; with Code, Transcribe, and Download buttons. The transcript shows timestamped segments from 5:53 to 6:53 with a speaker icon, reading: &quot;5:53 – 6:01 So pelicans love to, they're very good at getting the most they can out of the topography when they're flying. 6:01 – 6:06 And our winds come in from the northwest and they hit those bluffs and they're deflected up. 6:07 – 6:18 And they will sit right, they'll fly north into a wind like five feet off those bluffs, but just five or ten feet off the surface because the winds dissipate. 6:19 – 6:22 And they will surf that bluff all the way north. 6:23 – 6:30 So you'll see a wind from the north at 15 miles an hour, and the pelicans are flying north into that wind and not flapping their wings. 6:31 – 6:33 And it's one of the coolest things. 6:33 – 6:35 You can only find it on San Francisco Coast. 6:36 – 6:39 Where right where the bluffs are steep. 6:41 – 6:43 Pacifica, you can find them there. 6:43 – 6:51 They like their, what we call pier bums, which are typically pelicans that have, are in some sort of trouble. 6:51 – 6:53 They're unable to catch food.&quot; The segment at 6:41–6:43 is highlighted in yellow. An audio waveform is shown at the bottom with a playhead near 6:40. Stats in the lower right show 53.90s, 7946.00s, and #45833." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mistral-transcript-ui.jpg" />
