The Go ecosystem is <em>really</em> good at tooling. I just learned about this tool for analyzing the size of Go binaries using a pleasing treemap view of their bundled dependencies.</p>
<p>You can install and run the tool locally, but it's also compiled to WebAssembly and hosted at <a href="https://gsa.zxilly.dev/">gsa.zxilly.dev</a> - which means you can open compiled Go binaries and analyze them directly in your browser.</p>
<p>I tried it with a 8.1MB macOS compiled copy of my Go <a href="https://github.com/simonw/showboat">Showboat</a> tool and got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Treemap visualization of a Go binary named &quot;showboat&quot; showing size breakdown across four major categories: &quot;Unknown Sections Size&quot; (containing __rodata __TEXT, __rodata __DATA_CONST, __data __DATA, and Debug Sections Size with __zdebug_line __DWARF, __zdebug_loc __DWARF, __zdebug_info __DWARF), &quot;Std Packages Size&quot; (showing standard library packages like runtime, net, crypto, reflect, math, os, fmt, strings, syscall, context, and many subpackages such as crypto/tls, crypto/x509, net/http, with individual .go files visible at deeper levels), &quot;Main Packages Size&quot; (showing main, showboat, cmd), and &quot;Generated Packages Size&quot; (showing &lt;autogenerated&gt;). A tooltip is visible over __zdebug_line __DWARF showing: Section: __zdebug_line __DWARF, Size: 404.44 KB, File Size: 404.44 KB, Known size: 0 B, Unknown size: 404.44 KB, Offset: 0x52814a – 0x58d310, Address: 0x1005c014a – 0x1005c5310, Memory: false, Debug: true. The treemap uses green for main/generated packages, blue-gray for unknown sections, and shades of purple/pink for standard library packages." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/showboat-treemap.jpg" />
