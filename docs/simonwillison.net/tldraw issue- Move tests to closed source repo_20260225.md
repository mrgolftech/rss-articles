<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/8082">tldraw issue: Move tests to closed source repo</a></strong></p>
It's become very apparent over the past few months that a comprehensive test suite is enough to build a completely fresh implementation of any open source library from scratch, potentially in a different language.</p>
<p>This has worrying implications for open source projects with commercial business models. Here's an example of a response: tldraw, the outstanding collaborative drawing library (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/16/tldrawdraw-a-ui/">previous coverage</a>), are moving their test suite to a private repository - apparently in response to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/">Cloudflare's project to port Next.js to use Vite in a week using AI</a>.</p>
<p>They also filed a joke issue, now closed to <a href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/8092">Translate source code to Traditional Chinese</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current tldraw codebase is in English, making it easy for external AI coding agents to replicate. It is imperative that we defend our intellectual property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that tldraw aren't technically open source - their <a href="https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">custom license</a> requires a commercial license if you want to use it in "production environments".
