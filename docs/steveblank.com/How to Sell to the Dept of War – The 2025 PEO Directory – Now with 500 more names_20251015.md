Posted on October 15, 2025 by steve blank 

**The October 2025 PEO Directory – Update 2.**

The Department of War (DoW) is one of the world’s largest organizations. If you’re a startup trying to figure out who to call on and how to navigate the system, it can be – to put it politely – challenging.[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/500-new-additions.jpg?resize=247%2C311&ssl=1)](https://www.americasfrontier.com/aff-resources)Those inside the DoW have little perspective of how hard it is to understand what to an outsider looks like in an impenetrable, incredibly complex system.

Insiders know who to call, and prime contractors have teams of people following broad area announcements and contracts, but if you're startup, you have none of those relationships. (And with the advent of Social Media even our adversaries have better knowledge.)

If we’re serious about building a next generation defense ecosystem (not just buying the next shiny object), then this is the directory _the Department of War should be publishing_.

Until then, here’s the second update to the Department of War PEO Directory.  
_500 new names/organizations_ in this DoW phonebook and startup Go-to-Market Strategy playbook.

(See Appendix H for a summary of the changes.)
