{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://steveblank.com/feed/', 'value': '<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John 8:32</span></i></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every once in a while you learn something new that makes you completely rethink how/why an event actually happened.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you consider how it affects the rest of our country and our lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of those stories.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a decade ago, I was a public official and was at one of our commission meetings on the coast of California. A fellow commissioner and I decided to take a long lunchtime walk along the coast. As we chatted, we realized we had both worked on several of the same very classified programs. His involvement was in acquisition and finance, while mine was more deeply connected to the engineering development of the project and hands-on with the operators on site.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Got Our Advanced Technology From Aliens<br />\n</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we both were discreet about not talking about specifics, we recognized the projects we had worked on. So you can imagine my surprise when he turned to me and casually said, &#8220;You know this technology came from aliens.&#8221; I laughed, thinking that obviously he must be joking. But as we continued walking he continued on, claiming, “You know the equipment you worked on and stuff that followed came from our secret alien investigation site at <a href="https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/12/18/6-urban-legends-about-wright-patterson-air-force-base.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wright Patterson Air Force Base</a>. All we did was reverse engineer Alien technology.” This time I stopped in my tracks and looked at him to see if he was smiling. I was puzzled as he looked dead serious. He explained that there was no possible way we could be doing what we were doing using existing technology. Before I changed the subject I asked him how he knew this, he replied with absolute sincerity, “I was head of acquisition on the program. I was briefed on the project. That&#8217;s what they told us and they swore us to secrecy.“<a href="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33503" height="143" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=300%2C143&#038;ssl=1" width="300" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really didn&#8217;t know how to process this. He was really a smart and level-headed guy. In fact he was the mayor at the time of Rancho Palos Verde. It took me a mile or two into our walk to rethink everything I knew about the project (even then it had been in decades past), including having sat with a few of the engineers (some strange, but not aliens) as they were designing the system (with me trying to keep up with the revised blueprints in document control), and then watching the system being built and assembled. While it had required incredibly creative engineering, and applying technology on a scale so massive no commercial company could afford it, this system was built by smart people with no aliens involved. But he was equally convinced they were. Over our time together on the commission we took more walks, had lots more to talk about, but we never broached the subject again.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every once in a while, for the next few years, I puzzled on how he could have been so sure of something that I was sure was completely wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Did Tell Them It Was Aliens<br />\n</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward 15 years, and my world view of that conversation was upended when I read in the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Department of Defense had been running a disinformation campaign, briefing finance and acquisition people that the technology for these classified programs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coming from aliens. (Take a minute and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read the article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden our coast-side conversation from a decade and a half ago made sense to me. Most of our most compartmentalized programs have different levels of what was called &#8220;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; I never paid much attention as I was </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read all the way into</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technical and operational details of these programs. I vaguely knew that others got fewer details, but as I was just discovering, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">others had received active disinformation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a few cases, security officers were even using fake photos and documents to create the Alien cover-story for secret-weapons programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out my fellow commissioner had been briefed by the U.S. government that it was Aliens, and he went to his grave believing it so.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><b>Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?<br />\n</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting is what happened after the news came out that the Alien story was government disinformation. A large percentage of people who were briefed, now &#8220;doubled down&#8221; and believed “we got the technology from Aliens” even more strongly &#8211; believing the new information itself was a coverup. Many dismissed the facts by prioritizing how they felt over reality, something we often see in political or religious contexts. (“Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?”)</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered how my friend would have reacted.</span></p>\n<p><b>Secrecy, Disinformation, and a Higher Power<br />\n</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While on its face this is an amusing story about secrecy, it’s really about the intersection of the secrecy&#8217;s impact on society and its role in misinformation, manipulation, the creation of cynicism and mistrust, and our need to believe in a higher power.</span></p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-33555 alignright" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1" width="300" /></a></p>\n<p><b><i>Manipulation<br />\n</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of secrecy used for manipulation in the 20th century was when the </span><a href="https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/opening-the-venona-files/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Security Agency Venona </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unmasked Soviet spies</a> in the U.S. Even though this was one of the nation&#8217;s most secret programs, the FBI leaked its findings to Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon. They used this classified knowledge to manipulate the American public, fueling McCarthyism and Richard Nixon’s career. 50 years later, when </span><a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Helpful-Links/NSA-FOIA/Declassification-Transparency-Initiatives/Historical-Releases/Venona/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was made public historians substantively revised the history of U.S. Cold War politics.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 21st century Social Media misinformation (e.g. Chinese and Russian influence campaigns, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qanon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conspiracies) will look like toys next to the AI-driven manipulation that’s about to come.</span></p>\n<p><em><b>Cynicism and mistrust<br />\n</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrecy created 75 years of cynicism and mistrust, when the U.S. began launching highly classified reconnaissance balloons (story </span><a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/01/28/balloon-wars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and later the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes. These top secret projects gave rise to decades of UFO sightings. Instead of acknowledging these sightings were from classified military projects the Department of Defense issued cover stories (&#8220;you saw weather balloons&#8221;) that weren&#8217;t believable.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments and companies have always kept secrets and used misinformation and manipulation. However, things stay secret way too long &#8211; for many reasons &#8211; some reasonable (we’re still using the same methods &#8211; reconnaissance technology, tradecraft, or, it would harm people still alive &#8211; retired spies, etc) or not so reasonable (we broke U.S. or international laws &#8211; </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COINTELPRO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or it would embarrass us or our allies &#8211; Kennedy assassination, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epstein files</a>).\xa0\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrecy increases the odds of conspiracy beliefs. Because evidence can’t be checked, contradictions can’t be audited, a government “cover-up” becomes a plausible explanation. People don’t tolerate “I don’t know” for long when stakes are high (stolen elections, identity, national crises, the meaning of life, or what happens when we die). That vacuum gets filled by the most emotionally satisfying model: a hidden “higher power” concealing information and controlling events.</span></p>\n<p><b>Summary<br />\n</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as social media replaced traditional news sources, AI-driven summaries of current events are likely to replace our understanding of the world around us. What happens to trust when AI manipulates human&#8217;s tendency to embrace conspiracy theories? Who will define the truth in the brave new world?</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by the way, I’m still pretty sure we didn&#8217;t get it from Aliens.</span></p>'}
