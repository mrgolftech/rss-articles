  I remember how dismayed Kasparov was after losing the 1997 match to
  IBM's Deep Blue, although his views on Deep Blue became more
  balanced with time and he accepted that we had entered a new era in
  which computers would outperform grandmasters at chess.
</p>
<p>
  Still, chess players can take comfort in the fact that chess is
  still played between humans.  Players make their name and fame by
  beating other humans because playing against computers is no longer
  interesting as a competition.
</p>
<p>
  Many software developers would like to have similar comfort.  But
  that comfort is harder to find, because unlike chess, building
  prototypes or PoCs is not seen as a sport or art form.  It is mostly
  seen as a utility.  So while brain-coding a PoC may still be
  intellectually satisfying for the programmer, to most other people
  it only matters that the thing works.  That means that programmers
  do not automatically get the same protected space that chess players
  have, where the human activity itself remains valued even after
  machines become stronger.  The activity programmers enjoy may
  continue but the recognition and economic value attached to it may
  shrink.
</p>
<p>
  So I think the big adjustment software developers have to make is
  this: The craft will still exist and we will still enjoy doing it
  but the credit and value will increasingly go to those who define
  problems well, connect systems, make good product decisions and make
  technology useful in messy real-world situations.  It has already
  been this way for a while and will only become more so as time goes
  by.
