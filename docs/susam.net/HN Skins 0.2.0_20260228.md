<p>
  HN Skins 0.2.0 is a minor update of HN Skins.  It comes a day after
  its <a href="https://susam.net/0.1.0.html">initial release</a> in order to fine tune a
  few minor issues with the styles in the initial release.  HN Skins
  is a web browser userscript that adds custom themes to Hacker News
  and allows you to browse HN with different visual styles.
</p>
<p>
  This update removes excessive vertical space below the 'reply'
  links, sorts the skin options alphabetically in the selection dialog
  and fixes the background colour of the navigation bar in the
  Terminal skin by changing it from a dark grey to a dark green.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after making this release, I discovered a few other minor
  issues, such as the Cafe and Terminal themes using Courier when I
  intended them to use the system monospace font.  This has already
  been fixed in the development version currently available on GitHub.
  However, I will make a formal release later.
