# QuickQWERTY 1.2.1

By **Susam Pal** on 27 Jan 2026

QuickQWERTY 1.2.1 is now available. QuickQWERTY is a web-based touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards that runs directly in the web browser. 

This release contains a minor bug fix in Unit 4.3. Unit 4.3 is a 'Control' unit that lets you practise typing partial words as well as full words. In one place in this unit, the following sequence of partial and full words occurs: 
    
    
    l li lime lime

The full word `lime` was incorrectly repeated twice. This has been fixed to: 
    
    
    l li lim lime

To try out QuickQWERTY, go to [quickqwerty.html](../../../quickqwerty.html).
