16 January 2026

I’m in Oslo! Flighty is telling me I’ve flown in or out of here 43 times since a visit in 2014 [set me on a new path professionally](https://www.troyhunt.com/ndc-2014-vikings-passwords-and/) and, many years later, [personally](https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1601122643998298112?s=61&t=beHN95Zd9G3fQiuO1h_jzA&ref=troyhunt.com). It’s special here, like a second home that just feels… [right](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02PyWvy8Jr9EAkG7pjNBefryMgfTZuvGNtqyzi4g39Nq3VbQBuSJytSjybrZoEPKSHl&id=588950508&ref=troyhunt.com). This week, the business end of things is about the WhiteDate data breach. Seeking a partner along common racial lines isn’t unusual, but… well… WhiteDate is anything but usual. And, just for fun, see if you can pick the thing that garnered the most negative feedback about that blog post this week, I’ll feature the discussion in the next vid.
