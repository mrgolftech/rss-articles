18 January 2026

I thought Scott would cop it first when [he posted about what his solar system really cost him last year](https://scotthelme.co.uk/what-a-year-of-solar-and-batteries-really-saved-us-in-2025/?ref=troyhunt.com). "You're so gonna get that stupid AI-slop response from some people", I joked. But no, he got _other_ stupid responses instead! [And _I_ got the AI-slop responses!](https://infosec.exchange/@troyhunt/115887606042888443?ref=troyhunt.com) Draw your own conclusions on those comments, but I find it fascinating that the one thing people would take away from a thoughtful blog post I spent many hours writing to explain how much work I put into privacy is that the illustration was computer-generated. That such feedback aligns with the political leanings of folks on Mastodon is also fascinating, and probably something I should have seen coming. But hey, there's nothing new about folks popping their heads up to make inane comments where none were needed, and I have a special blog post for just such occasions: [If You Don't Want Guitar Lessons, Stop Following Me](https://www.troyhunt.com/if-you-dont-want-guitar-lessons-stop-following-me/).
