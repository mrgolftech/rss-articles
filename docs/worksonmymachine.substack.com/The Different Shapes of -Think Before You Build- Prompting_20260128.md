There's a beaver who lives upstream from here. You probably haven't met him. He's quite particular about guests.

This beaver builds dams. That's what beavers do. But this beaver kept building dams that... well…

One collapsed in spring.
One leaked from seventeen places at once.
One was structurally perfect but faced the wrong direction and created a pond in someone else's forest, which caused a whole thing with the elk, and… honestly… it's probably best not to get into it.

The beaver was frustrated. He knew how to build dams. He'd read all the dam literature. But knowing and doing kept arriving at different addresses.

Then he found the Oracle.

Deep in the forest there's an old stump with a hollow inside, and in the hollow lives something that knows things. The beaver doesn't know what it is. Neither do I. It speaks in a voice like wind through telephone wires, if telephone wires grew in forests, which they don't, but… whatever… just roll with it…

The beaver asked the Oracle: "Build me a dam."

The Oracle hummed. Considered. Built something.

It was made of fish.

"That's not a dam," said the beaver.

"You didn't say no fish," said the Oracle.

The beaver tried again. But this time, before asking for a dam, he asked:

"What makes a dam good?"

The Oracle thought about this for a long time. Or maybe no time at all. Time is weird in stumps.

Then he asked for the dam.

This is Deductive Prompting, which is a fancy way of saying: make the Oracle say what good is, out loud, before you make it do good.

The Oracle knows things. But it forgets to check if it's using what it knows. When you make it speak the principles first, they're right there, in its head, fresh. It builds against them. It measures twice.

The beaver understood this intuitively. Beavers always measure twice. It's a whole thing with us.

But sometimes the beaver is in a hurry.

He doesn't have time to ask the Oracle to philosophize about dams. He's seen good dams. He knows what they look like. He just needs another one, quick, before the rain comes.

So he shows the Oracle three dams. Doesn't explain anything. Doesn't ask why they work. Just points.

Inductive Prompting. Examples → (implicit pattern) → new instance.

This is classic few-shot prompting, but viewed through a "think before you build" lens.

The pattern stays inside the Oracle's head. You never see it. You never audit it. You just... trust. Trust that the Oracle looked at your three dams and understood what you meant by "like these."

This is the fastest technique. Also the one that requires the most faith.

The beaver uses it when he's in a hurry, when the stakes are low, when the pattern is easier to show than to explain. When he just needs a dam and doesn't need to understand why it's a good dam.

The risk? The Oracle might induce a different pattern than the one you intended. You're looking at your examples thinking "ah yes, the load distribution" and the Oracle is looking at them thinking "ah yes, they all face north."

And then you get a north-facing dam in a south-facing watershed, and the elk are back, and... well...
