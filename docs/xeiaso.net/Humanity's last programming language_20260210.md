{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://xeiaso.net/blog.rss', 'value': '<p>In Blade Runner, Deckard hunts down replicants, biochemical labourers that are basically indistinguishable from humans. They were woven into the core of Blade Runner\'s society with a temporal Sword of Damocles hung over their head: four years of life, not a day more. This made replicants desperate to cling to life; they\'d kill for the chance of an hour more. This is why the job of the Blade Runner was so deadly.</p>\n        <p>Metanarratively, the replicants weren\'t the problem. The problem was the people that made them. The people that gave them the ability to think. The ability to feel. The ability to understand and emphathize. The problem was the people that gave them the ability to enjoy life and then hit them with a temporal Sword of Damocles overhead because those replicants were fundamentally disposable.</p>\n        <p>In Blade Runner, the true horror was not the technology. The technology worked fine. The horror was the deployment and the societal implications around making people disposable. I wonder what underclass of people like that exists today.</p>\n        <div class="flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1"><div class="h-16 not-prose"><img alt="Numa is neutral" class="h-16 w-16 rounded-xs" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/neutral" /></div><div class="flex-1 min-w-0"><span class="font-semibold text-sm block mb-1"><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span class="mx-auto"></span><div class="text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2"><p>This is why science fiction is inseparable from social commentary, all the\n        best art does this.

Enjoy being cursed for life!</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>I keep thinking about those scenes when I watch people interact with AI agents. With these new flows, the cost to integrate any two systems is approaching zero; the most expensive thing is time. People don\'t read documentation anymore, that\'s a job for their AI agents. Mental labour is shifting from flesh and blood to HBM and coil whine. The thing doing the &quot;actual work&quot; is its own kind of replicant and as long as the results &quot;work&quot;, many humans don\'t even review the output before shipping it.</p>\n        <p>Looking at this, I think I see where a future could end up. Along this line, I\'ve started to think about how programming is going to change and what humanity\'s &quot;last programming language&quot; could look like. I don\'t think we\'ll stop making new ones (nerds are compulsive language designers), but I think that in the fallout of AI tools being so widespread the <em>shape</em> of what &quot;a program&quot; is might be changing drastically out from under us while we argue about tabs, spaces, and database frameworks.</p>\n        <p>Let\'s consider a future where markdown files are the new executables. For the sake of argument, let\'s call this result Markdownlang.</p>\n        <h2>Markdownlang</h2>\n        <p>Markdownlang is an AI-native programming environment built with structured outputs and Markdown. Every markdownlang program is an AI agent with its own agentic loop generating output or calling tools to end up with structured output following a per-program schema.</p>\n        <p>Instead of using a parser, lexer, or traditional programming runtime, markdownlang programs are executed by large language models running an agentic inference loop with structured JSON and a templated prompt as an input and then emitting structured JSON as a response.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang programs can import other markdownlang programs as dependencies. In that case they will just show up as other tools like any other. If you need to interact with existing systems or programs, you are expected to expose those tools via <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> servers. MCP tools get added to the runtime the same way any other tools would. Those MCP tools are how you do web searches, make GitHub issues, or update tickets in Linear.</p>\n        <h3>Why?</h3>\n        <p>Before you ask why, lemme cover the state of the art with the AI ecosystem for discrete workflows like the kind markdownlang enables: it\'s a complete fucking nightmare. Every week we get new agent frameworks, DSLs, paridigms, or CLI tools that only work with one provider for no reason. In a desperate attempt to appear relevant, everything has massive complexity creep requiring you(r AI agent) to write miles of YAML, struggle through brittle orchestration, and makes debugging a nightmare.</p>\n        <p>The hype says that this mess will replace programmers, but speaking as someone who uses these tools professionally in an effort to figure out if there really is something there to them, I\'m not really sure it will. Even accounting for multiple generational improvements.</p>\n        <h3>The core of markdownlang</h3>\n        <p>With this in mind, let\'s take a look at what markdownlang brings to the table.</p>\n        <p>The most important concept with markdownlang is that your documentation and your code are the same thing. One of the biggest standing problems with documentation is that the best way to make any bit of it out of date is to write it down in any capacity. Testing documentation becomes onerous because over time humans gain enough finesse to not require it anymore. One of the biggest advantages of AI models for this usecase is that they legitimately cannot remember things between tasks, so your documentation being bad means the program won\'t execute consistently.</p>\n        <p>Other than that, everything is just a composable agent. Agents become tools that can be used by other agents, and strictly typed schemata holds the entire façade together. No magic required.</p>\n        <p>Oh, also the markdownlang runtime has an embedded python interpreter using WebAssembly and WASI. The runtime does not have access to any local filesystem folders. It is purely there because language models have been trained to shell out to Python to do calculations (I\'m assuming someone was inspired by <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/strawberry">my satirical post where I fixed the &quot;strawberry&quot; problem with AI models</a>).</p>\n        <h2>Fizzbuzz</h2>\n        <p>Here\'s what Fizzbuzz looks like in markdownlang:</p>\n        <pre

imagine, the possibilities here are truly endless.</p>\n        <h2>A new layer of abstraction</h2>\n        <p>Yeah, I realize that a lot of this is high-brow shitposting, but really the best way to think about something like markdownlang is that it\'s a new layer of abstraction. In something like markdownlang the real abstraction you deal with is the specifications that you throw around in Jira/Linear instead of dealing with the low level machine pedantry that is endemic to programming in today\'s Internet.</p>\n        <p>Imagine how much more you could get done if you could just ask the computer to do it. This is the end of syntax issues, of semicolon fights, of memorizing APIs, of compiler errors because some joker used sed to replace semicolons with greek question marks. Everything becomes strictly typed data that acts as the guardrails between snippets of truly high level language.</p>\n        <p>Like, looking at the entire langle mangle programming space from that angle, the user experience at play here is that kind of science fiction magic you see in Star Trek. You just ask the computer to adjust the Norokov phase variance of the phasers to a triaxilating frequency and it figures out what you mean and does it. This is the kind of magic that Apple said they\'d do with AI in their big keynote <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/">right before they squandered that holy grail</a>.</p>\n        <p>Even then, this is still just programming. Schemata are your new types, imports are your new dependencies, composition is your new architecture, debugging is still debugging, and the massive MCP ecosystem becomes an integration boon instead of a burden.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang is just a tool. Large language models can (and let\'s face it: will) make mistakes. Schemata can\'t express absolutely everything. Someone needs to write these agents and even if something like this becomes so widespread, I\'m pretty sure that programmers are still safe in terms of their jobs.</p>\n        <p>If only because in order for us to truly be replaced, the people that hire us have to know what they want at a high enough level of detail in order to specify it such that markdownlang can make it possible. I\'d be willing to argue that when we get hired as programmers, we get hired to have that level of deep clear thinking to be able to come up with the kinds of requirements to get to the core business goal regardless of the tools we use to get it done.</p>\n        <p>It\'s not <em>that</em> deep.</p>\n        <h2>Future ideas</h2>\n        <p>From here something like this has many obvious and immediate usecases. It\'s quite literally a universal lingua franca for integrating any square peg into any other round hole. The big directions I could go from here include:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Some kind of web platform for authoring and deploying markdownlang programs (likely with some level of MCP exposure so that you can tell your Claude Code to make an agent do something every hour or so and have it just Do The Right Thing™️ spawning something in the background).</li>\n        <li>It would be really funny to make a <code>markdownlang compile</code> command that just translates the markdownlang program to Go, Python, or JavaScript; complete with the MCP imports as direct function calls.</li>\n        <li>I\'d love to make some kind of visual flow editor in that web platform, maybe there\'s some kind of product potential here. It would be really funny to attribute markdownlang to Techaro\'s AGI lab (Lygma).</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>But really, I think working on markdownlang (I do have a fully working version of it, I\'m not releasing it yet) has made me understand a lot more of the nuance that I feel with AI tools. That melodrama of Blade Runner has been giving me pause when I look at what I have just created and making me understand the true horror of why I find AI tooling so cool and disturbing at the same time.</p>\n        <p>The problem is not the technology. The real horror reveals itself when you consider how technology is deployed and the societal implications around what could happen when a tool like markdownlang makes programmers like me societally disposable. When &quot;good enough&quot; becomes the ceiling instead of the floor, we\'re going to lose something we can\'t easily get back.</p>\n        <p>The real horror for me is knowing that this kind of tool is not only possible to build with things off the shelf, but knowing that I did build it by having a small swarm of Claudes Code go off and build it while I did raiding in Final Fantasy 14. I haven\'t looked at basically any of the code (intentionally, it\'s part of The Bit™️), and it just works well enough that I didn\'t feel the need to dig into it in much detail. It\'s as if programmers now have our own Sword of Damocles over our heads because management can point at the tool and say &quot;behave more like this or we\'ll replace you&quot;.</p>\n        <p>This is the level of nuance I feel about this technology that can\'t fit into a single tweet. I love this idea of programming as description, but I hate how something like this will be treated by the market should it be widely released.</p>\n        <div class="flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1"><div class="h-16 not-prose"><img alt="Cadey is coffee" class="h-16 w-16 rounded-xs" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee" /></div><div class="flex-1 min-w-0"><span class="font-semibold text-sm block mb-1"><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span class="mx-auto"></span><div class="text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2"><p>For those of you entrenched in The Deep Lore™️, this post was authored in the\n        voice of <a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters/#numa">Numa</a>.</p></div></div></div>'}
