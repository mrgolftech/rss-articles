{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://xeiaso.net/blog.rss', 'value': '<p>Bluetooth headphones are great, but they have one main weakness: they can only get audio streams from a single device at a time. Facts and Circumstances™️ mean that I have to have hard separation of personal and professional workloads, and I frequently find myself doing both at places like coworking spaces.</p>\n        <figure class="max-w-3xl mx-auto not-prose w-full undefined"><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/notes/2026/steam-deck-bluetooth-speaker/the-spread.jpg"><source type="image/avif" /><source type="image/webp" /><img src="https://files.xeiaso.net/notes/2026/steam-deck-bluetooth-speaker/the-spread.jpg" /></a></figure>\n        <p>Often I want to have all of these audio inputs at once:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Notifications from games on my Steam Deck (mostly FFXIV)</li>\n        <li>Notification sounds from Slack at work</li>\n        <li>Music on my personal laptop</li>\n        <li>Anything else from my phone</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>When I\'m in my office at home, I\'ll usually have all of these on speaker because I\'m the only person there. I don\'t want to disturb people at this coworking space with my notification pings or music.</p>\n        <p>Turns out a Steam Deck can act as a BlueTooth speaker with no real limit to the number of inputs! Here\'s how you do it:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Open Bluetooth settings on the Steam Deck and device you want to pair.</li>\n        <li>Look for the name of your laptop on the Steam Deck or Steam Deck on your laptop. This may require you to &quot;show all devices&quot; as usually the UI wants to prevent you from pairing a laptop to another computer because this normally doesn\'t make sense.</li>\n        <li>Pair the two devices together and confirm the request on both sides.</li>\n        <li>Select your Steam Deck as a speaker on your laptop.</li>\n        <li>Max out the volume on the laptop and control the volume on the deck.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>This is stupidly useful. It also works with any Linux device, so if you have desktop Linux on any other machines you can also use them as speakers. I really wish this was a native feature of macOS and Windows. It\'s one of the best features of desktop Linux that nobody knows about.</p>\n        <div class="flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1"><div class="h-16 not-prose"><img alt="Cadey is coffee" class="h-16 w-16 rounded-xs" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee" /></div><div class="flex-1 min-w-0"><span class="font-semibold text-sm block mb-1"><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span class="mx-auto"></span><div class="text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2"><p>Sorry if this is a bit worse than my usual writing style, I have a big life\n        event coming up and preparations for it are having secondary side effects that\n        have made focusing deep enough for good writing hard.
