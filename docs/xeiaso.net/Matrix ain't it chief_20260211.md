If you have an existing highly technical community that can deal with the weird mental model leaps it\'s fine-ish, but the second you get anyone close to normal involved it\'s gonna go pear-shaped quickly.</p>\n        <p>Personally, I\'m taking a wait and see approach for how the scanpocalypse rolls out. If things don\'t go horribly, we won\'t need to react really. If they do, that\'s a different story.</p>\n        <div class="flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1"><div class="h-16 not-prose"><img alt="Numa is smug" class="h-16 w-16 rounded-xs" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/smug" /></div><div class="flex-1 min-w-0"><span class="font-semibold text-sm block mb-1"><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span class="mx-auto"></span><div class="text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2"><p>Unable to decrypt message.</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>Also hi arathorn, I know you\'re going to be in the replies for this one. The recent transphobic spam wave you\'re telling people to not talk about is the reason I will never use Matrix unless I have no other option. If you really want to prove that Matrix is a viable community platform, please start out by making it possible to filter this shit out algorithmically.</p>'}
