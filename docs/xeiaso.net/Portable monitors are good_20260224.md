When I\'m in my office I normally have a seven monitor battlestation like this:</p>\n        <center><blockquote class="bluesky-embed"><p lang="en"><br /><br /><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:e5nncb3dr5thdkjir5cfaqfe/post/3mdefsnld4s2t?ref_src=embed"><p>[image or embed]</p></a></p><p>— Xe (</p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:e5nncb3dr5thdkjir5cfaqfe?ref_src=embed"><p>@xeiaso.net</p></a><p>) </p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:e5nncb3dr5thdkjir5cfaqfe/post/3mdefsnld4s2t?ref_src=embed"><p>January 26, 2026 at 11:34 PM</p></a></blockquote></center>\n        <p>So as you can imagine, travel sucks for me because I just constantly run out of screen space. This can be worked around, I minimize things more, I just close them, but you know what is better? Just having another screen.</p>\n        <p>On a whim, I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0B2PJNG8D?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title">this 15.6&quot; Innoview portable monitor</a> off of Amazon. It\'s a 1080p screen that I hook up to my laptop or Steam Deck with USB-C. However, the exact brand and model doesn\'t matter. You can find them basically anywhere with the most AliExpress term ever: screen extender.</p>\n        <figure class="max-w-3xl mx-auto not-prose w-full undefined"><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2026/portable-monitors/IMG_0749.jpg"><source type="image/avif" /><source type="image/webp" /><img src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2026/portable-monitors/IMG_0749.jpg" /></a></figure>\n        <p>This monitor is at least half decent. It is not a colour-accurate slice of perfection. It claims to support HDR but actually doesn\'t. Its brightness out of the box could be better. I could go down the list and really nitpick until the cows come home but it really really doesn\'t matter. It\'s portable, 1080p, and good enough.</p>\n        <p>When I was at a coworking space recently, it proved to be one of the best purchases I\'ve ever made. I had Slack off to the side and was able to just use my computer normally. It was so boring that I have difficulty trying to explain how much I liked it.</p>\n        <p>This is the dream when it comes to technology.</p>\n        <p>3/5, I would buy a second one.</p>'}
