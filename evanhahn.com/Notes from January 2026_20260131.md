<p>Happy new year! Here are some of my notes from the first month of 2026.</p>
<h2 id="new-job-at-ghost">New job at Ghost!</h2>
<p>I started a new job as a Staff Engineer at <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> this month. According to our homepage, Ghost is &ldquo;for professional publishers to create, share, and grow a business around their content.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m looking forward to building software for independent journalists.</p>
<p>This is also the third time in a row I&rsquo;ve chosen to work for a nonprofit. It&rsquo;s a pattern now: nonprofits are my default choice of where to work.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-did">Things I did</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate">libdeflate</a> does &ldquo;fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression&rdquo;. I published <a href="https://codeberg.org/EvanHahn/libdeflate.js">libdeflate.js</a>, which wraps it up for JavaScript users. Always feels good to use a little WebAssembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recently set every single option in <a href="https://codeberg.org/EvanHahn/dotfiles/src/commit/b33b8a10e687b35c06456fe763232af8349c7a39/home/vim/.config/nvim/init.vim">my Vim configuration</a>, and blogged about it in <a href="https://evanhahn.com/i-set-all-376-vim-options-and-im-still-a-fool/">&ldquo;I set all 376 Vim options and I&rsquo;m still a fool&rdquo;</a>. Even though I learned a lot setting every flag, I still feel far from mastering an editor I&rsquo;ve used for almost 14 years. There was some good discussion on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/0ashr1">Lobsters</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1qepll2/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46652690">Hacker News</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While everyone else is using state-of-the-art chatbots, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://evanhahn.com/an-llm-thats-7500x-stupider/">an LLM that&rsquo;s 7500 times stupider</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/on-writing-well-william-zinsser"><em>On Writing Well</em></a> by William Zinsser and <a href="https://evanhahn.com/on-writing-well-book-notes/">published my notes</a>. Zinsser&rsquo;s writing isn&rsquo;t to my taste, but I still learned a lot from this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To approximate the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit, double it and add 30. For the reverse, subtract 30 and halve it. For example, if it&rsquo;s 12ºC, this heuristic would return 54ºF: (12 × 2) + 30 = 54. The actual amount is not far off: 53.6ºF. For more, see <a href="https://evanhahn.com/fahrenheit-celsius-heuristic/">&ldquo;A mental math heuristic to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear by <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">&ldquo;Learn X in Y minutes&rdquo;</a>, a great website that offers quick tours of programming languages. I&rsquo;m proud to have contributed <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/rink/">a page on Rink</a>, a powerful command line calculator I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://evanhahn.com/rink-cheatsheet/">gushed about previously</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like every month, <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/author/evan-hahn/">I published a few articles over at Zelda Dungeon</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="links-and-bookmarks">Links and bookmarks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The calendar turns, and once again a lively procession of books, images, films, and music leaves copyright behind and steps into the ever-growing public domain!&rdquo; I celebrated <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/">Public Domain Day</a> by reading Agatha Christie&rsquo;s <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie/the-murder-at-the-vicarage"><em>Murder at the Vicarage</em></a>.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Shoutout to Minneapolis for its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/23/minnesota-economic-blackout-ice-protests">strike against the ICE occupation</a>, and shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/generalstrikeus.bsky.social/post/3m76lyeczhk2k">General Strike US</a>, and the <a href="https://nationalshutdown.org/">National Shutdown</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of ICE, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-asks-companies-about-ad-tech-and-big-data-tools/">they&rsquo;re requesting &ldquo;ad tech&rdquo; data for surveillance</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;What has Meta itself observed about the harms tied to its products?&rdquo; Turns out, <a href="https://metasinternalresearch.org/">a lot</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew about <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use</a>, an invaluable index of browser support for various web APIs. But this month, I learned about <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/">Can I email</a>, a counterpart for email clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learned <a href="https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/">several tricks about the <code>less</code> command</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://javascript-mascot.github.io/">A mascot for JavaScript!</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;In American cities, for example: though at first the automobile enabled humans to travel further distances, it now <em>demanded</em> that humans travel those distances, and <em>demanded</em> infrastructure be created &amp; maintained to enable it.&rdquo; From <a href="https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/">&ldquo;A website to destroy all websites&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://werd.io/who-owns-your-data/">&ldquo;Who owns your data?&rdquo;</a> argues that it could be useful to think of personal data as property, from a legal perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you had a good January.</p>
