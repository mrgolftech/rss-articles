The more people tweet about how MLP-Mixer is overhyped because is −X% worse than the ultra-hand-optimized baseline or requires Y× more FLOPS, the more they demonstrate\nprecisely why\nthis sort of research is so important!

How many have you even heard of?)\nBaron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás\n(noted geologist, paleontologist, anthropologist, homosexual, & skyjacker)\nKrishnacore\nWhat is a diffusion model like DDPM? To try to explain it as simply as possible\nwithout the math\n:\nDDPM is a neural net which is trained to fix noise in an image: it takes a noisy image and ‘sharpens’ it to produce a new image. You train it by adding dirt to a normal image, and teaching it to turn the dirty version into the original. As it gets better, it learns what the images all tend to look like so it can ‘see through’ ever more noise, to turn smudged hints of the original image into its best guess. Once it’s done training, what happens if you give it a completely dirty photo, which is pure static noise? Well, it produces a slightly less dirty ‘photo’. And if you do it again? it’s a little cleaner still. Now, what if you do this many times? It has to get cleaner each time. The end result: the static noise goes in, and a face pops out! The DDPM has hallucinated a face out of the noise. One little blob of static here turned into a nose, and another blob turned into an ear, and it went from there. - RSS Articles</title>

              May 2021 Gwern.net Newsletter\n\n来源: https://gwern.net\n链接: https://gwern.substack.com/p/may-2021-gwernnet-newsletter\n日期: Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:16:22 GMT\n\n---\n\nMay 2021’s\nGwern.net\nnewsletter\nis now out; previous,\nApril 2021\n(\narchives\n). This is a collation of links and summary of major changes, overlapping with my\nChangelog\n; brought to you by my donors on\nPatreon\n.\nNote: I will be in Denver 12–13 June 2021 for a conference.\n1 Writings\nProposal\n:\n“Choose Your Own Adventure AI Dungeon”\n;\n“Decision Transformers: Preference Learning As Simple As Possible”\n2 Links\n2.1 AI\nMatters Of Scale\n:\nHardware\n:\n“Podracer architectures for scalable Reinforcement Learning”\n, Hessel et al 2021 (highly-efficient TPU pod use: eg solving Pong in &lt;1min at 43 million FPS on a TPUv3-2048);\n“Google details new TPUv4 AI accelerator chips”\n(2.7× TPUv3 chips; up to TPUv4-4096 pods, yielding &gt;1 ExaFLOPS; public access later in 2021)x\n“ZeRO-Infinity: Breaking the GPU Memory Wall for Extreme Scale Deep Learning”\n, Rajbhandari et al 2021 (~1 trillion parameters per 16 GPUs/DGX-2-node, scaling to &gt;512 GPUs ~40% efficiency)\n“GSPMD: General and Scalable Parallelization for ML Computation Graphs”\n, Xu et al 2021 (Google upgrade of\nGPipe\n/\nGShard\narch to match\nMS DeepSpeed\n: “…50%–62% compute utilization on 128–2048 Cloud TPUv3 cores for models with up to one trillion parameters”)\n“DLRM: High-performance, Distributed Training of Large-scale Deep Learning Recommendation Models”\n, Mudigere et al 2021 (ZionEX software/hardware platform for training extremely large embeddings—while embeddings aren’t ‘real’ parameters &amp; things like\nDynamicEmbedding\nwill never learn tricks like GPT-3 no matter how big, they present similar challenges);\n“RecPipe: Co-designing Models and Hardware to Jointly Optimize Recommendation Quality and Performance”\n, Gupta et al 2021\n“From Motor Control to Team Play in Simulated Humanoid Football”\n, Liu et al 2021 (curriculum training of a single NN from raw humanoid control to coordinated team-wide soccer strategy; neat to compare with\nHill et al 2020\nin terms of agent abilities)\n“Wav2vec-U: Unsupervised Speech Recognition”\n, Baevski et al 2021\n“Anthropic” public-benefit-corp/startup launched\n(founded by the Amodeis; $124M investment for scaling “reliable and steerable AI systems”);\n“Cooperative AI Foundation” (CAIF)\nlaunched\n“MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision”\n, Tolstikhin et al 2021 (another\nFC paper\nremoving even more inductive biases—ponies are all you need: “Mixer\nimproves more rapidly with data\nthan ResNets, or even ViT, and the gap between large scale Mixer and ViT models shrinks until the performance is matched on the entire dataset…” The Bitter Lesson truly is the single bitterest lesson in ML, isn’t it? The more people tweet about how MLP-Mixer is overhyped because is −X% worse than the ultra-hand-optimized baseline or requires Y× more FLOPS, the more they demonstrate\nprecisely why\nthis sort of research is so important! And showing, incidentally, that Transformers are still under-researched if such a fundamental fact could have been missed for so long.)\n“Data-Efficient Language-Supervised Zero-Shot Learning with Self-Distillation”\n, Cheng et al 2021 (\nCLIP\n-like performance scaled down to\nn\n= 3m using\nsoft labels\ngenerated by a\nConceptual Captions\n-pretrained model)\n“SR3: Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement”\n, Saharia et al 2021;\n“Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis”\n, Dhariwal &amp; Nichol 2021 (\nDDPM\n^\n1\n^ finally surpass\nBigGAN-deep\non ImageNet 512px images at similar compute-cost, as\nexpected from their\ngood scaling\n);\n“Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation”\n, Ho et al 2021\n“Learning to summarize from human feedback”\n, Stiennon et al 2020\n“Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting On Small Algorithmic Data Sets”\n, Power et al 2021 (\ndiscussion\n; new scaling effect, ‘grokking’: sudden perfect generalization emerging many epochs after training-set overfitting on algorithmic tasks when training in\nflat shallow loss landscapes\n);\n“Knowledge distillation: A good teacher is patient and consistent”\n, Beyer et al 2021 (training much smaller models merely requires hundreds of thousands or millions of epochs)\n“Scaling End-to-End Models for Large-Scale Multilingual ASR”\n, Li et al 2021\n“The Shape of Learning Curves: a Review”\n, Viering &amp; Loog 2021\n“Reward is enough”\n, Silver et al 2021 (a DRL manifesto: reward losses enough at scale of compute/parameters/tasks to induce all important capabilities like memory/exploration/generalization/imitation/reasoning)\nScaling Down\n:\nlazy\n: a tool for running processes in idle time\n(how to train on a GPU without destroying your GUI’s usability!\nlazy\npauses runs briefly while you interact with your desktop, letting you do months-long runs without going crazy or resorting to Colab etc. This enables hobbyists to go after previously-infeasible model sizes); EleutherAI releases\na 6b-parameter GPT-3 model, GPT-J\n(are you still using GPT-2/GPT-Neo?

To try to explain it as simply as possible\nwithout the math\n:\nDDPM is a neural net which is trained to fix noise in an image: it takes a noisy image and ‘sharpens’ it to produce a new image. You train it by adding dirt to a normal image, and teaching it to turn the dirty version into the original. As it gets better, it learns what the images all tend to look like so it can ‘see through’ ever more noise, to turn smudged hints of the original image into its best guess. Once it’s done training, what happens if you give it a completely dirty photo, which is pure static noise? Well, it produces a slightly less dirty ‘photo’. And if you do it again? it’s a little cleaner still. Now, what if you do this many times? It has to get cleaner each time. The end result: the static noise goes in, and a face pops out! The DDPM has hallucinated a face out of the noise. One little blob of static here turned into a nose, and another blob turned into an ear, and it went from there.

The more people tweet about how MLP-Mixer is overhyped because  is −X% worse than the ultra-hand-optimized baseline or requires Y× more  FLOPS, the more they demonstrate\nprecisely why\nthis sort of  research is so important!

To try to explain it as simply as possible\nwithout the math\n:\nDDPM is a neural net which is trained to fix noise in an image: it  takes a noisy image and ‘sharpens’ it to produce a new image. You train  it by adding dirt to a normal image, and teaching it to turn the dirty  version into the original. As it gets better, it learns what the images  all tend to look like so it can ‘see through’ ever more noise, to turn  smudged hints of the original image into its best guess. Once it’s done  training, what happens if you give it a completely dirty photo, which is  pure static noise? Well, it produces a slightly less dirty ‘photo’. And  if you do it again? it’s a little cleaner still. Now, what if you do  this many times? It has to get cleaner each time. The end result: the  static noise goes in, and a face pops out! The DDPM has hallucinated a  face out of the noise. One little blob of static here turned into a  nose, and another blob turned into an ear, and it went from there.<a class="headerlink"
