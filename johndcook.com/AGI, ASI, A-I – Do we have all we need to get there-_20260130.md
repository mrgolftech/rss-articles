Since then, we have had several major new advances, like reasoning models and tool use. If we&#8217;d said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t need anything else&#8221; three years ago, where would we be now?</p>\n<p>For frankness, I like this from John Schulman: &#8220;it&#8217;s hard to know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqVbypvxDto&amp;t=2s">what we need.</a>&#8221; And for strategy, Demis: &#8220;you can think of as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqVbypvxDto&amp;t=2s">50% of our effort is on scaling, 50% of it is on innovation</a>. My betting is you&#8217;re going to need both to get to AGI.&#8221;</p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/01/30/agi-asi-ai-do-we-have-all-we-need-to-get-there/">AGI, ASI, A*I – Do we have all we need to get there?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
