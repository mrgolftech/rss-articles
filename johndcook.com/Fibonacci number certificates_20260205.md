How could you confirm this?</p>\n<p>Before I go further, let me say what this post is really about. It&#8217;s not about Fibonacci numbers so much as it is about proofs and certificates. There&#8217;s no market for large Fibonacci numbers, and certainly no need to quickly verify that a number is a Fibonacci number.</p>\n<p>You could write a program to generate Fibonacci numbers, and run it until it either produces\xa0<em>F</em> , in which case you know\xa0<em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number, or the program produces a larger number than\xa0<em>F</em> without having produced\xa0<em>F</em>, in which case you know it&#8217;s not a Fibonacci number. But there&#8217;s a faster way.</p>\n<p>A certificate is data that allows you to confirm a solution to a problem in less time, usually far less time, than it took to generate the solution. For example, <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/01/03/pratt-certificate/">Pratt certificates</a> give you a way to prove that a number is prime. For a large prime, you could verify its Pratt certificate much faster than directly trying to prove the number is prime.</p>\n<p>There is a theorem that says a number\xa0<em>f</em> is a Fibonacci number if and only if one of 5<em>f</em><sup>2</sup>\xa0± 4 is a perfect square. So in addition to <em>F</em> another number\xa0<em>r</em> that is a certificate that\xa0<em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number. You compute</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>N</em> = 5<em>F</em>² − <em>r</em>²</p>\n<p>and if <em>N</em> is equal to 4 or −4, you know that <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number. Otherwise it is not.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a small example. Suppose I give you (12586269025, 28143753123) and claim that the first number is a Fibonacci number and the second number is its certificate. You can compute</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5 × 12586269025² − 28143753123²</p>\n<p>and get −4, verifying the claim.</p>\n<p>Certificates are all about the amount of computation the verifier needs to do. The prover, i.e. the person producing the certificate, has to do extra work to provide a certificate in addition to a problem solution. This trade-off is acceptable, for example, in a <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/crypto/">blockchain</a> where a user posts one transaction but many miners will verify many transactions.</p>\n<h2>Related posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/01/13/ecpp/">Elliptic curve primality certificates</a></li>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2024/11/30/generation-verification-costs/">Generation versus verification costs</a></li>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/01/13/proof-of-optimization/">Proof of optimization</a></li>\n<li class="link"><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/11/29/zkp-composite/">Zero knowledge proof of compositeness</a></li>\n</ul>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/05/fibonacci-certificate/">Fibonacci number certificates</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
