The radius of the earth is about 6400 km, so the volume of the LEO region is</p>\n<p><img alt="\\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\left((6400 + 2000)^3 - (6400 + 160)^3\\right) \\text{km}^3 = 1.3 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{km}^3" class="aligncenter" height="40" src="https://www.johndcook.com/satellite_room2.svg" style="background-color: white;" width="484" /></p>\n<p>There are about 12,500 satellites in LEO, so the average volume of LEO per satellite is about 100,000,000 km³.</p>\n<p>Now this isn&#8217;t the last word in collision avoidance—there are lots of complications we&#8217;re not going to get into here—but it is the first word: <strong>there&#8217;s a lot of space in space</strong>.</p>The post <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/02/satellites-have-a-lot-of-room/">Satellites have a lot of room</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog">John D.
