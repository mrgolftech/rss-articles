Package management had a strong presence again this year, with a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/package-management/">dedicated devroom</a> plus related content scattered across the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/distributions/">Distributions</a>, <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/nix-and-nixos/">Nix and NixOS</a>, and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/sboms-and-supply-chains/">SBOMs and Supply Chains</a> tracks.</p>\n\n<h2 id="main-track-talks">Main Track Talks</h2>\n\n<p>Kenneth Hoste presented <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DCAVDC-how_to_make_package_managers_scream/">How to Make Package Managers Scream</a>, a follow-up to his FOSDEM 2018 talk about making package managers cry. Hoste showcased creative and effective ways open source software projects take things to the next level to make package managers scream, along with tools that try to counter these practices.</p>\n\n<p>Mike McQuaid gave <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/YUJUKD-what_happened_to_rubygems_and_what_can_we_learn/">What happened to RubyGems and what can we learn?</a> examining the February 2024 RubyGems and Bundler infrastructure incident.</p>\n\n<h2 id="package-management-devroom">Package Management Devroom</h2>\n\n<p>The Package Management devroom, which I organized with Wolf Vollprecht, ran on Saturday with nine talks covering security, standards, and practical implementation challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Harvey opened with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/GFA3RJ-a_phishy_case_study/">A phishy case study</a> about the September 2024 phishing attack on crates.io. The attack targeted popular crate owners as part of a wider campaign across language ecosystems. Harvey detailed how the Rust Project, Rust Foundation, and Alpha-Omega collaborated to mitigate it rapidly. Mike Fiedler\n<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@miketheman/116008792409955286">posted a follow-up on Mastodon</a> describing how attackers were able to circumvent 2FA.\nIn short, TOTP 2FA does not include phishing resistance (compared to WebAuthn or Passkeys), so the TOTP codes can be collected and forwarded\nto the target service the same way that passwords are.</p>\n\n<p>Zach Steindler presented <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/BCFZP7-current-state-programming-language-attestations/">Current state of attestations in programming language ecosystems</a>, comparing how npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and Maven Central have implemented attestations over the past few years. These attestations provide build provenance by linking packages to exact source code and build instructions, distributed as Sigstore bundles. Steindler covered the APIs for accessing attestations in each ecosystem and discussed implementation tradeoffs.</p>\n\n<p>Gábor Boskovits explored <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/BJCN93-name-resolution-in-package-managers/">Name resolution in package management systems - A reproducibility perspective</a>, comparing how different systems handle package dependencies. He looked at language-specific package managers with lock files (Cargo), typical distributions (Debian), and functional package managers (Nix and Guix), then reflected on these approaches from a reproducible builds angle.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Gibb presented <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3SANYS-package-managers-a-la-carte/">Package managers à la carte: A Formal Model of Dependency Resolution</a>, introducing the Package Calculus. This formalism aims to unify the core semantics of diverse package managers, showing how real-world features reduce to the core calculus. Gibb demonstrated Pac, a language for translating between distinct package managers and performing dependency resolution across ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Suozzo gave <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EP8AMW-oss-rebuild-observability/">Trust Nothing, Trace Everything: Auditing Package Builds at Scale with OSS Rebuild</a>. While reproducible builds confirm artifacts match expectations, they treat the build process as a black box. OSS Rebuild instruments the build environment to detect malicious behavior in real-time using a transparent network proxy for uncovering hidden remote dependencies and an eBPF-based system analyzer for examining build behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Philippe Ombredanne returned with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/P8AAT3-purl/">PURL: From FOSDEM 2018 to international standard</a>. Package-URL was <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/purl/">first presented at FOSDEM</a> eight years ago and has now become an international standard for referencing packages across ecosystems. Ombredanne highlighted PURL’s adoption in CVE format, security tools, and SCA platforms, and its journey from community project to Ecma standard with plans for ISO standardization.</p>\n\n<p>Vlad-Stefan Harbuz spoke about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/7NQJNU-binary_dependencies_identifying_the_hidden_packages_we_all_depend_on/">Binary Dependencies: Identifying the Hidden Packages We All Depend On</a>, examining dependencies that don’t appear in standard package manager manifests. Related: <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/27/the-c-shaped-hole-in-package-management.html">the C-shaped hole in package management</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Winser discussed <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/8WJKEH-package-registry-economics/">The terrible economics of package registries and how to fix them</a>, looking at the sustainability challenges facing package registry infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Mike McQuaid closed the devroom with <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FGBYKV-package_management_learnings_from_homebrew/">Package Management Learnings from Homebrew</a>, covering lessons from 16 years of maintaining Homebrew and the recent v5.0.0 release.</p>\n\n<h2 id="distributions-devroom">Distributions Devroom</h2>\n\n<p>The Distributions devroom on Sunday covered 16 talks about building and maintaining Linux distributions.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Mellado and Mikel Olasagasti tackled <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/VSXPA8-packaging-ebpf-in-linux-distros/">Packaging eBPF Programs in a Linux Distribution: Challenges &amp; Solutions</a>. eBPF introduces unique challenges including kernel dependencies, CO-RE relocations, pinning behavior, and version-aligned tooling. They explored specific issues in Fedora like pinned maps, privilege models, reproducible builds, SELinux implications, and managing kernel updates.</p>\n\n<p>František Lachman and Cristian Le presented <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/MCNHUF-from-code-to-distribution-testing-pipeline/">From Code to Distribution: Building a Complete Testing Pipeline</a> about the Packaging and Testing Experience (PTE) project.
