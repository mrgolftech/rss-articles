To prove it, you need only pick up <em>The Universe Box</em>, Swanwick\'s just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field\'s greatest writers at the absolute <em>pinnacle</em> of his game:</p>\n<p><a href="https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/">https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/</a></p>\n<p>Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is  a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, <em>multiple</em> sf magazines that publish short stories <em>every month</em>, on <em>paper</em>, and <em>pay for it</em>. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels.</p>\n<p>That\'s a pretty common trajectory in sf, where &#8211; notwithstanding the field\'s status as a haven for the short story &#8211; the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick.</p>\n<p>It\'s a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can\'t assume anything about the story\'s setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies.</p>\n<p>All of that has to be established <em>in the story</em>. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There\'s a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad ("show, don\'t tell"). It\'s fairer to say that exposition is <em>hard</em> &#8211; dramatization is, well, <em>dramatic</em>, which makes it easier to engage the reader\'s attention. But great exposition is <em>great</em> and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well:</p>\n<p><a href="https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/">https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/</a></p>\n<p>The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls "incluing," "the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information":</p>\n<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html</a></p>\n<p>Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the <em>reader</em> work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you\'ve been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that\'s not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded.</p>\n<p>This is a terrific experience, but it is also <em>work</em>. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the <em>story</em> part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the "difficult jazz" of literature, a form and genre that requires &#8211; and rewards &#8211; very active attention.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain\'s classic comedic short, "The Petrified Man":)</p>\n<p><a href="https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/">https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/</a></p>\n<p>But here\'s the thing. <em>None of this applies to Swanwick</em>. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there\'s never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It\'s not merely that he\'s a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last.</p>\n<p>Somehow, though, he just <em>slides</em> these stories into your brain.</p>\n<p>And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise <em>beginnings</em> (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else).</p>\n<p>This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.</p>\n<p>This is a book of worlds that each exist for just a handful of pages but occupy more space than those pages could possibly contain. It\'s a series of cigar boxes, each with the universe inside of it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a name="linkdump"></a></p>\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/23/the-last-days-of-old-night/#linkdump">permalink</a>)</h1>\n<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. Envoys Refused to Report "Apocalyptic" Conditions in Gaza.
