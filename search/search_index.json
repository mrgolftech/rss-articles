Now, to be clear, those workers haven\u2019t been laid off because their jobs are now being done by AI, and they\u2019ve been replaced by bots. Instead, they\u2019ve been laid off by execs who now have AI to use as an excuse for going after workers they\u2019ve wanted to cut all along.</p>\\n<p>This is important to understand for a few reasons. First, it\u2019s key just for having empathy for both the mindset and the working conditions of people in the tech industry. For so many outside of tech, their impression of what \u201ctech\u201d means is whatever is the most recent transgression they\u2019ve heard about from the most obnoxious billionaire who\u2019s made the news lately. But in many cases, it\u2019s the rank and file workers at that person\u2019s company who were the first victims of that billionaire\u2019s ego.</p>\\n<p>Second, it\u2019s important to understand the big tech companies as almost the testing grounds for the techniques and strategies that these guys want to roll out on the rest of the economy, and on the rest of the world. Before they started going on podcasts pretending to be extremely masculine while whining about their feelings, or overtly bribing politicians to give them government contracts, they beta-tested these manipulative strategies within their companies by cracking down on dissent and letting their most self-indulgent and egomaniacal tendencies run wild. Then, when people (reasonably!) began to object, they used that as an excuse to purge any dissenters for being uncooperative or \u201cdifficult\u201d.</p>\\nIt starts with tech, but doesn\u2019t end there\\n<p>These are tactics they\u2019ll be bringing to other industries and sectors of the economy, if they haven\u2019t already. Sometimes they\u2019ll be providing AI technologies and tools as an enabler or justification for the cultural and political agenda that they\u2019re enacting, but often times, they don\u2019t even need to. In many cases, they can simply make clear that they want to enforce psychological and social conformity within their organizations, and that any disagreement will not be tolerated, and the implicit threat of being replaced by automation (or by other workers who are willing to fall in line) is enough to get people to comply.</p>\\n<p>This is the subtext, and sometimes the explicit text, of the deployment of \u201cAI\u201d in a lot of organizations. That\u2019s separate from what actual AI software or technology can do. And it explains a lot of why the majority AI view within the tech industry is nothing like the hype cycle that\u2019s being pushed by the loudest voices of the big-name CEOs.</p>\\n<p>Because people who work in tech still believe in the power of tech to do good things, many of us won\u2019t just dismiss outright the possibility that any technology \u2014 even AI tools like LLMs\\xa0\u2014 could yield some benefits. But the optimistic takes are tempered by the first-hand knowledge of how the tools are being used as an excuse to sideline or victimize good people.</p>\\n<p>This wave of layoffs and reductions has been described as \u201cpursuing efficiencies\u201d or \u201cright-sizing\u201d. But so many of us in tech can remember a few years back, when working in tech as an upwardly-mobile worker with a successful career felt like the best job in the world. When many people could buy nice presents for their kids at Christmas or they weren\u2019t as worried about your car payments. When huge parts of society were promising young people that there was a great future ahead if they would just learn to code. When the promise of a tech career\u2019s potential was used as the foundation for building infrastructure in our schools and cities to train a whole new generation of coders.</p>\\n<p>But the funders and tycoons in charge of the big tech companies knew that they did not want to keep paying enormous salaries to the people they were hiring. They certainly knew they didn\u2019t want to keep paying huge hiring bonuses to young people just out of college, or to pay large staffs of recruiters to go find underrepresented candidates. Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as \u201cmarket inefficiencies\u201d which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to them. So yes, part of the reason for the huge investment in AI coding tools was to make it easier to write code. But another huge reason that AI got so good at writing code was so that nobody would ever have to pay coders so well again.</p>\\n<p>You\u2019re not wrong if you feel angry, resentful and overwhelmed by all of this; indeed, it would be absurd if you didn\u2019t feel this way, since the wealthiest and most powerful people in the history of the world have been spending a few years trying to make you feel exactly this way. Constant rotating layoffs and a nonstop fear of further cuts, with a perpetual sense of precarity, are a deliberate strategy so that everyone will accept lower salaries and reduced benefits, and be too afraid to push for the exact same salaries that the company could afford to pay the year before.</p>\\nWhy are we stirring the pot?\\n<p>Okay, so are we just trying to get each other all depressed? No. It\u2019s just vitally important that we name a problem and identify it if we\u2019re going to solve it.\\n\\u2028Most people outside of the technology industry think that \u201ctech\u201d is a monolith, that the people who work in tech are the same as the people who own the technology companies. They don\u2019t know that tech workers are in the same boat that they are, being buffeted by the economy, and being subject to the whims of their bosses, or being displaced by AI. They don\u2019t know that the DEI backlash has gutted HR teams at tech companies, too, for example. So it\u2019s key for everyone to understand that they\u2019re starting from the same place.</p>\\n<p>Next, it\u2019s key to tease apart things that are separate concerns. For example: AI is often an excuse for layoffs, not the cause of them. ChatGPT didn\u2019t replace the tasks that recruiters were doing in attracting underrepresented candidates at big tech companies \u2014 the bosses just don\u2019t care about trying to hire underrepresented candidates anymore! The tech story is being used to mask the political and social goal. And it\u2019s important to understand that, because otherwise people waste their time fighting battles that might not matter, like the deployment of a technology system, and losing the ones that do, like the actual decisions that an organization is making about its future.</p>\\nAre they efficient, though?\\n<p>But what if, some people will ask, these companies just had too many people? What if they\u2019d over-hired? The folks who want to feel really savvy will say, \u201cI heard that they had all those employees because interest rates were low. It was a Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.\u201d This is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. It\u2019s not in any company\u2019s best interests to cut their staffing down to the bone.</p>\\n<p>You actually need to have some reserve capacity for labor in order to reach maximum output for a large organization. This is the difference between a large-scale organization and a small one. People sitting around doing nothing is the epitome of waste or inefficiency in a small team, but in a large organization, it\u2019s a lot more costly if you are about to start a new process or project and you don\u2019t have labor capacity or expertise to deploy.</p>\\n<p>A good analogy is the oft-cited need these days for people to be bored more often. There\u2019s a frequent lament that, because people are so distracted by things like social media and constant interruptions, they never have time to get bored and let their mind wander, and think new thoughts or discover their own creativity. Put another way, they never get the chance to tap into their own cognitive surplus.</p>\\n<p>The only advantage a large organization can have over a small one, other than sheer efficiencies of scale, is if it has a cognitive surplus that it can tap into. By destroying that cognitive surplus, and leaving those who remain behind in a state of constant emotional turmoil and duress, these organizations are permanently damaging both their competitive advantages and their potential future innovations.</p>\\nAI Spring\\n<p>When the dust clears, and people realize that extreme greed is never the path to maximum long-term reward, there is going to be a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d of sorts from all the good talent that\u2019s now on the market. Some of this will be smart, thoughtful people flowing to other industries or companies, bringing their experience and insights with them.</p>\\n<p>But I think a lot of this will be people starting their own new companies and organizations, informed by the broken economic models, and broken human models, of the companies they\u2019ve left. We saw this a generation ago after the bust of the dot-com boom, when it was not only revealed that the economics of a lot of the companies didn\u2019t work, but that so many of the people who had created the companies of that era didn\u2019t even care about the markets or the industries that they\u2019d entered. When the get-rich-quick folks left the scene, those of us who remained, who truly loved the web as a creative and expressive medium, found a ton of opportunity in being the little mammals amidst the sad dinosaurs trying to find funding for meteor dot com.</p>\\nWhat comes next\\n<p>I don\u2019t think this all gets better very quickly. If you put aside the puffery of the AI companies scratching each others\u2019 backs, it\u2019s clear the economy is in a recession, even if this administration\u2019s goons have shut down reporting on jobs and inflation in a vain attempt to hide that reality. But I do think there may be more resilience because of the sheer talent and entrepreneurial skill of the people who are now on the market as individuals.</p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:11</p>"},{"location":"anildash.com/How%20the%20hell%20are%20you%20supposed%20to%20have%20a%20career%20in%20tech%20in%202026-/","title":"How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: anildash.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: https://anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>The number one question I get from my friends, acquaintances, and mentees in the technology industry these days is, by far, variations on the basic theme of, \u201cwhat the hell are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p>\\n<p>There have been mass layoffs that leave more tech workers than ever looking for new roles in the worst market we\u2019ve ever seen. Many of the most talented, thoughtful and experienced people in the industry are feeling worried, confused, and ungrounded in a field that no longer looks familiar.</p>\\n<p>If you\u2019re outside the industry, you may be confused \u2014 isn\u2019t there an AI boom that\u2019s getting hundreds of billions of dollars in investments? Doesn\u2019t that mean the tech bros are doing great? What you may have missed is that half a million tech workers have been laid off in the years since ChatGPT was released; the same attacks on marginalized workers and DEI and \u201cwoke\u201d that the tech robber barons launched against the rest of society were aimed at their own companies first.</p>\\n<p>So the good people who actually make the technology we use every day, the real innovators and creators and designers, are reacting to the unprecedented disconnect between the contemporary tech industry and the fundamentals that drew so many people toward it in the first place. Many of the biggest companies have abandoned the basic principle of making technology that actually works. So many new products fail to deliver on even the basic capabilities that the companies are promising that they will provide.</p>\\n<p>Many leaders at these companies have run full speed towards moral and social cowardice, abandoning their employees and customers to embrace rank hatred and discrimination in ways that they pretended to be fighting against just a few years ago. Meanwhile, unchecked consolidation has left markets wildly uncompetitive, leaving consumers suffering from the effects of categories without any competition or investment \u2014 which we know now as \u201censhittification\u201d. And the full-scale shift into corruption and crony capitalism means that winners in business are decided by whoever is shameless enough to offer the biggest bribes and debase themselves with the most humiliating display of groveling. It\u2019s a depressing shift for people who, earlier in their careers, often actually were part of inventing the future.</p>\\n<p>So where do we go from here?</p>\\nYou\u2019re not crazy.\\n<p>The first, and most important, thing to know is that it\u2019s not just you. Nearly everyone in tech I have this conversation with feels very isolated about it, and they\u2019re often embarrassed or ashamed to discuss it. They think that everyone else who has a job in tech is happy or comfortable at their current employers, or that the other people looking for work are getting calls back or are being offered interviews in response to their job applications. But I\u2019m here to tell you: it is grim right now. About as bad as I\u2019ve seen. And I\u2019ve been around a long time.</p>\\n<p>Every major tech company has watched their leadership abandon principles that were once thought sacrosanct. I\u2019ve heard more people talk about losing respect for executives they trusted, respected, even admired in the last year than at any time I can remember. In smaller companies and other types of organizations, the challenges have been more about the hard choices that come from dire resource constraints or being forced to make ugly ethical compromises for pragmatic reasons. The net result is tons of people who have lost pride and conviction in their work. They\u2019re going through the motions for a paycheck, because they know it\u2019s a tough job market out there, which is a miserable state of affairs.</p>\\n<p>The public narrative is dominated by the loud minority of dudes who are content to appease the egos of their bosses, sucking up to the worse impulses of those in charge. An industry that used to pride itself on publicly reporting security issues and openly disclosing vulnerabilities now circles its wagons to gang up on people who suggest that an AI tool shouldn\u2019t tell children to harm themselves, that perhaps it should be possible to write a law limiting schools from deploying AI platforms that are known to tell kids to end their own lives. People in tech endure their bosses using slurs at work, making jokes about sexual assault, consorting with leaders who have directly planned the murder of journalists, engaging in open bribery in blatant violation of federal law and their own corporate training on corruption, and have to act like it\u2019s normal.</p>\\n<p>But it\u2019s not the end of the world. The forces of evil have not yet triumphed, and all hope is not lost. There are still things we can do.</p>\\nTaking back control\\n<p>It can be easy to feel overwhelmed at such an unprecedented time in the industry, especially when there\u2019s so much change happening. But there are concrete actions you can take to have agency over your own career, and to insulate yourself from the bad actors and maximize your own opportunities \u2014 even if some of those bad actors are your own bosses.</p>\\nUnderstanding systems\\n<p>One of the most important things you can do is to be clear about your own place, and your own role, within the systems that you are part of. A major factor in the changes that bosses are trying to effect with the deployment of AI is shifting the role of workers within the systems in their organization to make them more replaceable.</p>\\n<p>If you\u2019re a coder, and you think your job is to make really good code in a particular programming language, you might double down on getting better at the details of that language. But that\u2019s almost certainly misunderstanding the system that your company thinks you\u2019re part of, where the code is just a means to the end of creating a final product. In that system-centric view, the programming language, and indeed all of the code itself, doesn\u2019t really matter; the person who is productive at causing all of that code to be created reliably and efficiently is the person who is going to be valued, or at least who is most likely to be kept around. That may not be satisfying or reassuring if you truly love coding, but at least this perspective can help you make informed decisions about whether or not that organization is going to make choices that respect the things you value.</p>\\n<p>This same way of understanding systems can apply if you\u2019re a designer or a product manager or a HR administrator or anything else. As I\u2019ve covered before, the purpose of a system is what it does, and that truth can provide some hard lessons if we find it\u2019s in tension with the things we want to be doing for an organization. The system may not value the things we do, or it may not value them enough; the way they phrase this to avoid having to say it directly is by describing something as \u201cinefficient\u201d. Then, the question you have to ask yourself is, can you care about this kind of work or this kind of program at one level higher up in the system? Can it still be meaningful to you if it\u2019s slightly more abstract? Because that may be the requirement for navigating the expectations that technology organizations will be foisting on everyone through the language of talking about \u201cadopting AI\u201d.</p>\\nUnderstanding power\\n<p>Just as important as understanding systems is understanding power. In the workplace, power is something real. It means being able to control how money is spent. It means being able to make decisions. It means being able to hire people, or fire them. Power is being able to say no.</p>\\n<p>You probably don\u2019t have enough power; that\u2019s why you have worries. But you almost certainly have more power than you think, it\u2019s just not as obvious how to wield it. The most essential thing to understand is that you will need to collaborate with your peers to exercise collective power for many of the most significant things you may wish to achieve.</p>\\n<p>But even at an individual level, a key way of understanding power in your workplace is to consider the systems that you are part of, and then to reckon with which ones you can meaningfully change from your current position. Very often, people will, in a moment of frustration, say \u201cthis place couldn\u2019t run without me!\u201d And companies will almost always go out of their way to prove someone wrong if they hear that message.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if you identify a system for operating the organization that no one else has envisioned, you\u2019ve already demonstrated that this part of the organization couldn\u2019t run without you, and you don\u2019t need to say it or prove it. There is power in the mere action of creating that system. But a lot depends on where you have both the positional authority and the social permission to actually accomplish that kind of thing.</p>\\n<p>So, if you\u2019re dissatisfied with where you are, but have not decided to leave your current organization, then your first orders of business in this new year should be to consolidate power through building alliances with peers, and by understanding which fundamental systems of your organization you can define or influence, and thus be in control of. Once you\u2019ve got power, you\u2019ve got options.</p>\\nMost tech isn\u2019t \u201ctech\u201d\\n<p>So far, we\u2019re talking about very abstract stuff. What do we do if your job sucks right now, or if you don\u2019t have a job today and you really need one? After vague things like systems and power, then what?</p>\\n<p>Well, an important thing to understand, if you care about innovation and technology, is that the vast majority of technology doesn\u2019t happen in the startup world, or even in the \u201ctech industry\u201d. Startups are only a tiny fraction of the entire realm of companies that create or use technology, and the giant tech companies are only a small percentage of all jobs or hiring within the tech realm.</p>\\n<p>So much opportunity, inspiration, creativity, and possibility lies in applying the skills and experience that you may have from technological disciplines in other realms and industries that are often far less advanced in their deployment of technologies. In a lot of cases, these other businesses get taken advantage of for their lack of experience \u2014\\xa0and in the non-profit world, the lack of tech expertise or fluency is often exploited by both the technology vendors and bad actors who swoop in to capitalize on their vulnerability.</p>\\n<p>Many of the people I talk to who bring their technology experience to other fields also tell me that the culture in more traditional industries is often less toxic or broken than things in Silicon Valley (or Silicon Valley-based) companies are these days, since older or more established companies have had time to work out the more extreme aspects of their culture. It\u2019s an extraordinary moment in history when people who work on Wall Street tell me that even their HR departments wouldn\u2019t put up with the kind of bad behavior that we\u2019re seeing within the ranks of tech company execs.</p>\\nPlan for the long term\\n<p>This too shall pass. One of the great gifts of working in technology is that it\u2019s given so many of us the habit of constantly learning, of always being curious and paying attention to the new things worth discovering. That healthy and open-minded spirit is an important part of how to navigate a moment when lots of people are being laid off, or lots of energy and attention are being focused on products and initiatives that don\u2019t have a lot of substance behind them.\\nEventually, people will want to return to what\u2019s real. The companies that focus on delivering products with meaning, and taking care of employees over time, will be the ones that are able to persist past the current moment. So building habits that enable resiliency at both a personal and professional level is going to be key.</p>\\n<p>As I\u2019ve been fond of saying for a long time: don\u2019t let your job get in the way of your career.</p>\\n<p>Build habits and routines that serve your own professional goals. As much as you can, participate in the things that get your name out into your professional community, whether that\u2019s in-person events in your town, or writing on a regular basis about your area of expertise, or mentoring with those who are new to your field. You\u2019ll never regret building relationships with people, or being generous with your knowledge in ways that remind others that you\u2019re great at what you do.</p>\\n<p>If your time and budget permit, attend events in person or online where you can learn from others or respond to the ideas that others are sharing. The more people can see and remember that you\u2019re engaged with the conversations about your discipline, the greater the likelihood that they\u2019ll reach out when the next opportunity arises.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, take every chance you can to be generous to others when you see a door open that might be valuable for them. I can promise you, people will never forget that you thought of them in their time of need, even if they don\u2019t end up getting that role or nabbing that interview.</p>\\nIt\u2019s an evolution, not a resolution\\n<p>New years are often a time when people make a promise to themselves about how they\u2019re going to change everything. If I can just get this new notebook to write in, I\u2019m suddenly going to become a person who keeps a journal, and that will make me a person who\u2019s on top of everything all the time.</p>\\n<p>But hopefully you can see, many of the challenges that so many people are facing are systemic, and aren\u2019t the result of any personal failings or shortcomings. So there isn\u2019t some heroic individual change that you can make when you flip over to a new calendar month that will suddenly fix all the things.</p>\\n<p>What you can control, though, are small iterative things that make you feel better on a human scale, in little ways, when you can. You can help yourself maintain perspective, and you can do the same for those around you who share your values, and who care about the same personal or professional goals that you do.</p>\\n<p>A lot of us still care about things like the potential for technology to help people, or still believe in the idealistic and positive goals that got us into our careers in the first place. We weren\u2019t wrong, or naive, or foolish to aspire to those goals simply because some bad actors sought to undermine them. And it\u2019s okay to feel frustrated or scared in a time when it seems to many like those goals could be further away than they\u2019ve been in a long time.</p>\\n<p>I do hope, though, that people can see that, by sticking together, and focusing on the things that are within our reach, things can begin to change. All it takes is remembering that the power in tech truly rests with all the people who actually make things, not with the loudmouths at the top who try to tear things down.</p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:11</p>"},{"location":"anildash.com/They%20have%20to%20be%20able%20to%20talk%20about%20us%20without%20us/","title":"They have to be able to talk about us without us","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: anildash.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: https://anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>It\u2019s absolutely vital to be able to communicate effectively and efficiently to large groups of people. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to get to refine and test my skills in communicating at scale for a few decades now, and the power of talking to communities is the one area where I\u2019d most like to pass on what I\u2019ve learned, because it\u2019s this set of skills that can have the biggest effect on deciding whether good ideas and good work can have their greatest impact.</p>\\n<p>My own work crosses many disparate areas. Over the years, I\u2019ve gotten to cycle between domains as distinct as building technology platforms and products for developers and creators, enabling activism and policy advocacy in service of humanist ideals, and more visible external-facing work such as public speaking or writing in various venues like magazines or on this site. (And then sometimes I dabble in my other hobbies and fun stuff like scholarship or research into areas like pop culture and media.)</p>\\n<p>What\u2019s amazing is, in every single one of these wildly different areas, the exact same demands apply when trying to communicate to broad groups of people. This is true despite the broadly divergent cultural norms across all of these different disciplines. It can be a profoundly challenging, even intimidating, job to make sure a message is being communicated accurately, and in high fidelity, to everyone that you need to reach.</p>\\n<p>That vital task of communicating to a large group gets even more daunting when you inevitably realize that, even if you were to find the perfect wording or phrasing for your message, you\u2019d still never be able to deliver your story to every single person in your target audience by yourself anyway. There will always be another person whom you\u2019re trying to reach that you just haven\u2019t found yet. So, is it hopeless? Is it simply impossible to effectively tell a story at scale if you don\u2019t have massive resources?</p>\\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be. We can start with one key insight about what it takes to get your most important stories out into the world. It\u2019s a perspective that seems incredibly simple at first, but can lead to a pretty profound set of insights.</p>\\nThey have to be able to talk about us without us.\\n<p>They have to be able to talk about us without us. What this phrase means, in its simplest form,  is that you have to tell a story so clear, so concise, so memorable and evocative that people can repeat it for you even after you\u2019ve left the room. And the people who hear it need to be able to do this the first time they hear the story. Whether it\u2019s the idea behind a new product, the core promise of a political campaign, or the basic takeaway from a persuasive essay (guess what the point of this one is!) \u2014\\xa0not only do you have to explain your idea and make your case, you have to be teaching your listener how to do the same thing for themselves.</p>\\n<p>This is a tall order, to be sure. In pop music, the equivalent is writing a hit where people feel like they can sing along to the chorus by the time they get to the end of the song for the first time. Not everybody has it in them to write a hook that good, but if you do, that thing is going to become a classic. And when someone else has done it, you know it because it gets stuck in your head. Sometimes you end up humming it to yourself even if you didn\u2019t want to. Your best ideas \u2014\\xa0your most vital ideas \u2014\\xa0need to rest on a messaging platform that solid.</p>\\n<p>Delivering this kind of story actually requires substance. If you\u2019re trying to fake it, or to force a narrative out of fluff or fakery, that will very immediately become obvious. When you set out to craft a story that travels in your absence, it has to have a body if it\u2019s going to have legs. Bullshit is slippery and smells terrible, and the first thing people want to do when you leave the room is run away from it, not carry it with them.</p>\\nThe mission is the message\\n<p>There\u2019s another challenge to making a story that can travel in your absence: your ego has to let that happen. If you make a story that is effective and compelling enough that others can tell it, then, well\u2026. those other people are going to tell it.  Not you. They\u2019ll do it in their own words, and in their own voices, and make it theirs. They may use a similar story, but in their own phrasing, so it will resonate better with their people. This is a gift! They are doing you a kindness, and extending you great generosity. Respond with gratitude, and be wary of anyone who balks at not getting to be the voice or the face of a message themselves. Everyone gets a turn telling the story.</p>\\n<p>Maybe the simple fact that others will be hearing a good story for the first time will draw them to it, regardless of who the messenger is. Sometimes people get attached to the idea that they have to be the one to deliver the one true message. But a core precept of \u201ctalk about us without us\u201d is that there\u2019s a larger mission and goal that everyone is bought into, and this demands that everyone stay aligned to their values rather than to their own personal ambitions around who tells the story.</p>\\n<p>The truth of whomever will be most effective is the factor used to decide who will be the person to tell the story in any context. And this is a forgiving environment, because even if someone doesn\u2019t get to be the voice one day, they\u2019ll get another shot, since repetition and consistency are also key parts of this strategy, thanks to the disciplined approach that it brings to communication.</p>\\nThe joy of communications discipline\\n<p>At nearly every organization where I\u2019ve been in charge of onboarding team members in the last decade or so, one of the first messages we\u2019ve presented to our new colleagues is, \u201cWe are disciplined communicators!\u201d It\u2019s a message that they hopefully get to hear as a joyous declaration, and as an assertion of our shared values. I always try to explicitly instill this value into teams I work with because, first, it\u2019s good to communicate values explicitly, but also because this is a concept that is very seldom directly stated.</p>\\n<p>It is ironic that this statement usually goes unsaid, because nearly everyone who pays attention to culture understands the vital importance of disciplined communications. Brands that are strictly consistent in their use of things like logos, type, colors, and imagery get such wildly-outsized cultural impact in exchange for relatively modest investment that it\u2019s mind-boggling to me that more organizations don\u2019t insist on following suit. Similarly, institutions that develop and strictly enforce a standard tone of voice and way of communicating (even if the tone itself is playful or casual) capture an incredibly valuable opportunity at minimal additional cost relative to how much everyone\u2019s already spending on internal and external communications.</p>\\n<p>In an era where every channel is being flooded with AI-generated slop, and when most of the slop tools are woefully incapable of being consistent about anything, simply showing up with an obviously-human, obviously-consistent story is a phenomenal way of standing out. That discipline demonstrates all the best of humanity: a shared ethos, discerning taste, joyful expression, a sense of belonging, an appealing consistency. And best of all, it represents the chance to participate for yourself \u2014 because it\u2019s a message that you now know how to repeat for yourself.</p>\\n<p>Providing messages that individuals can pick up and run with on their own is a profoundly human-centric and empowering thing to do in a moment of rising authoritarianism. When the fascists in power are shutting down prominent voices for leveling critiques that they would like to censor, and demanding control over an increasingly broad number of channels, there\u2019s reassurance in people being empowered to tell their own stories together. Seeing stories bubble up from the grassroots in collaboration, rather than being forced down upon people from authoritarians at the top, has an emotional resonance that only strengthens the substance of whatever story you\u2019re telling.</p>\\nHow to do it\\n<p>Okay, so it sounds great: Let\u2019s tell stories that other people want to share! Now, uh\u2026 how do we do it? There are simple principles we can follow that help shape a message or story into one that is likely to be carried forward by a community on its own.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ground it in your values. When we began telling the story of my last company Glitch, the conventional wisdom was that we were building a developer tool, so people would describe it as an \u201cIDE\u201d \u2014 an \u201cintegrated development environment\u201d, which is the normal developer jargon for the tool coders use to write their code in. We never described Glitch that way. From day one, we always said \u201cGlitch is the friendly community where you\\'ll build the app of your dreams\u201d (later, \u201cthe friendly community where everybody builds the internet\u201d). By talking about the site as a friendly community instead of an <code>integrated development environment</code>, it was crystal clear what expectations and norms we were setting, and what our values were. Within a few months, even our competitors were describing Glitch as a \u201cfriendly community\u201d while they were trying to talk about how they were better than us about some feature or the other. That still feels like a huge victory \u2014 even the competition was talking about us without us! Make sure your message evokes the values you want people to share with each other, either directly or indirectly.</li>\\n<li>Start with the principle. This is a topic I\u2019ve covered before, but you can\\'t win unless you know what you\\'re fighting for. Identify concrete, specific, perhaps even measurable goals that are tied directly to the values that motivate your efforts. As noted recently, Zohran Mamdani did this masterfully when running for mayor of New York City. While the values were affordability and the dignity of ordinary New Yorkers, the clear, understandable, measurable principle could be something as simple as \u201cfree buses\u201d. This is a goal that everyone can get in 5 seconds, and can explain to their neighbor the first time they hear it. It\u2019s a story that travels effortlessly on its own \u2014 and that people will be able to verify very easily when it\u2019s been delivered. That\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of \u201ctalk about us without us\u201d.</li>\\n<li>Know what makes you unique.Another way of putting this is to simply make sure that you have a sense of self-awareness. But the story you tell about your work or your movement has to be specific. There can\u2019t be platitudes or generalities or vague assertions as a core part of the message, or it will never take off. One of the most common failure states for this mistake is when people lean on slogans. Slogans can have their use in a campaign, for reminding people about the existence of a brand, or supporting broader messaging. But very often, people think a slogan is a story. The problem is that, while slogans are definitely repeatable, slogans are almost definitionally too vague and broad to offer a specific and unique narrative that will resonate. There\u2019s no point in having people share something if it doesn\u2019t say something. I usually articulate the challenge here like this:Only say what only you can say.</li>\\n<li>Be evocative, not comprehensive. Many times, when people are passionate about a topic or a movement, the temptation they have in telling the story is to work in every little detail about the subject. They often think, \u201cif I include every detail, it will persuade more people, because they\u2019ll know that I\u2019m an expert, or it will convince them that I\u2019ve thought of everything!\u201d In reality, when people are not subject matter experts on a topic, or if they\u2019re not already intrinsically interested in that topic, hearing a bunch of extensive minutia about it will almost always leave them feeling bored, confused, intimidated, condescended-to, or some combination of all of these. Instead, pick a small subset of the most emotionally gripping parts of your story, the aspects that have the deepest human connection or greatest relevance and specificity to the broadest set of your audience, and focus on telling those parts of the story as passionately as possible. If you succeed in communicating that initial small subset of your story effectively, then you may earn the chance to tell the other more complex and nuanced details of your story.</li>\\n<li>Your enemies are your friends. Very often, when people are creating messages about advocacy, they\u2019re focused on competition or rivals. In the political realm, this can be literal opposing candidates, or the abstraction of another political party. In the corporate world, this can be (real or imagined) competitive products or companies. In many cases, these other organizations or products or competitors occupy so much more mental space in your mind, or your team\u2019s mind, than they do in the mind of your potential audience. Some of your audience has never heard of them at all. And a huge part of your audience thinks of you and your biggest rival as\u2026 basically the same thing. In a business or commercial context, customers can barely keep straight the difference between you and your competition \u2014 you\u2019re both just part of the same amorphous blob that exists as \u201cthe things that occupy that space\u201d. Your competitor may be the only other organization in the world that\u2019s fighting just as hard as you are to create a market for the product that you\u2019re selling. The same is true in the political space; sometimes the biggest friction arises over the narcissism of small differences. What we can take away from these perspectives is that our stories have to focus on what distinguishes us, yes, but also on what we might have in common with those whom we might otherwise have perceived to have been aligned with the \u201cenemy\u201d. Those folks might not have sworn allegiance to an opposing force; they may simply have chosen another option out of convenience, and not even seen that choice as being in opposition to your story at all.</li>\\n<li>Find joy in repetition. Done correctly, a disciplined, collaborative, evocative message can become a mantra for a community. There\u2019s a pride and enthusiasm that can come from people becoming proficient in sharing their own version of the collective story. And that means enjoying when that refrain comes back around, or when a slight improvement in the core message is discovered, and everyone finds a way to refine the way they\u2019re communicating about the narrative. A lot of times, people worry that their team will get bored if they\u2019re \u201cjust telling the same story over and over all the time\u201d. In reality, as a brilliant man once said, there\u2019s joy in repetition.</li>\\n<li>Don\u2019t obsess over exact wording. This one is tricky; you might say, \u201cbut you said we have to be disciplined communicators!\u201d And it\u2019s true: it\u2019s important to be disciplined. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t leave room for people to put their own spin on things. Let them translate to their own languages or communities. Let them augment a general principle with a specific, personal connection. If they have their own authentic experience which will amplify a story or drive a point home, let them weave that context into the consistent narrative that\u2019s been shared over time. As long as you\u2019re not enabling a \u201ctelephone game\u201d where the story starts to morph into an unrecognizable form, it\u2019s perfectly okay to add a human touch by going slightly off script.</li>\\n</ul>\\nShare the story\\n<p>Few things are more rewarding than when you find a meaningful narrative that resonates with the world. Stories have the power to change things, to make people feel empowered, to galvanize entire communities into taking action and recognizing their own power. There\u2019s also a quiet reward in the craft and creativity of working on a story that travels, in finding notes that resonate with others, and in challenging yourself to get far enough out of your own head to get into someone else\u2019s heart.</p>\\n<p>I still have so much to learn about being able to tell stories effectively. I still screw it up so much of the time, and I can look back on many times when I wish I had better words at hand for moments that sorely needed them. But many of the most meaningful and rewarding moments of my life have been when I\u2019ve gotten to be in community with others, as we were not just sharing stories together, but telling a united story together. It unlocks a special kind of creativity that\u2019s a lot bigger than what any one of us can do alone.</p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:11</p>"},{"location":"anildash.com/Vibe%20Coding-%20Empowering%20and%20Imprisoning/","title":"Vibe Coding: Empowering and Imprisoning","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: anildash.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: https://anildash.com/2025/12/02/vibe-coding-empowering-and-imprisoning/</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>In case you haven\u2019t been following the world of software development closely, it\u2019s good to know that vibe coding \u2014 using LLM tools to assist with writing code \u2014\\xa0can help enable many people to create apps or software that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to make. This has led to an extraordinarily rapid adoption curve amongst even experienced coders in many different disciplines within the world of coding. But there\u2019s a very important threat posed by vibe coding that almost no one has been talking about, one that\u2019s far more insidious and specific than just the risks and threats posted by AI or LLMs in general.</p>\\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick summary:</p>\\n<p>One of the most effective uses of LLMs is in helping programmers write code A huge reason VCs and tech tycoons put billions into funding LLMs was so they could undermine coders and depress wages</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Vibe coding might limit us to making simpler apps instead of the radical innovation we need to challenge Big Tech</li>\\n</ul>\\nStart vibing\\n<p>It may be useful to start by explaining how people use LLMs to assist with writing software. My background is that I\u2019ve helped build multiple companies focused on enabling millions of people to create with code. And I\u2019m personally an example of one common scenario with vibe coding. Since I don\u2019t code regularly anymore, I\u2019ve become much slower and less efficient at even the web development tasks that I used to do professionally, which I used to be fairly competent at performing. In software development, there are usually a nearly-continuous stream of new technologies being released (like when you upgrade your phone, or your computer downloads an update to your web browser), and when those things change, developers have to update their skills and knowledge to stay current with the latest tools and techniques. If you\u2019re not staying on top of things, your skillset can rapidly decay into irrelevance, and it can be hard to get back up to speed, even though you understand the fundamentals completely, and the underlying logic of how to write code hasn\u2019t changed at all. It\u2019s like knowing how to be an electrician but suddenly you have to do all your work in French, and you don\u2019t speak French.</p>\\n<p>This is the kind of problem that LLMs are really good at helping with. Before I had this kind of coding assistant, I couldn\u2019t do any meaningful projects within the limited amount of free time that I have available on nights and weekends to build things. Now, with the assistance of contemporary tools, I can get help with things like routine boilerplate code and obscure syntax, speeding up my work enough to focus on the fun, creative parts of coding that I love.</p>\\n<p>Even professional coders who are up to date on the latest technologies use these LLM tools to do things like creating scripts, which are essentially small bits of code used to automate or process common tasks. This kind of code is disposable, meaning it may only ever be run once, and it\u2019s not exposed to the internet, so security or privacy concerns aren\u2019t usually much of an issue. In that context, having the LLM create a utility for you can feel like being truly liberated from grunt work, something like having a robot vacuum around to sweep up the floor.</p>\\nSurfing towards serfdom\\n<p>This all sounds pretty good, right? It certainly helps explain why so many in the tech world tend to see AI much more positively than almost everyone else does; there\u2019s a clear-cut example of people finding value from these tools in a way that feels empowering or even freeing.</p>\\n<p>But there are far darker sides to this use of AI. Let me put aside the threats and risks of AI that are true of all uses of the Big AI platforms, like the environmental impact, the training on content without consent, the psychological manipulation of users, the undermining of legal regulations, and other significant harms. These are all real, and profound, but I want to focus on what\u2019s specific to using AI to help write code here, because there are negative externalities that are unique to this context that people haven\u2019t discussed enough. (For more on the larger AI discussion, see \"What would good AI look like?\")</p>\\n<p>The first problem raised by vibe coding is an obvious one: the major tech investors focused on making AI good at writing code because they wanted to make coders less powerful and reduce their pay. If you go back a decade ago, nearly everyone in the world was saying \u201cteach your kids to code\u201d and being a software engineer was one of the highest paying, most powerful individual jobs in the history of labor. Pretty soon, coders were acting like it \u2014\\xa0using their power to improve workplace conditions for those around them at the major tech companies, and pushing their employers to be more socially responsible. Once workers began organizing in this way, the tech tycoons who founded the big tech companies, and the board members and venture capitalists who backed them, immediately began investing billions of dollars in building these technologies that would devalue the labor of millions of coders around the world.</p>\\n<p>It worked. More than half a million tech workers have been laid off in America since ChatGPT was released in November 2022.</p>\\n<p>That\u2019s just in the private sector, and just the ones tracked by layoffs.fyi.  Software engineering job listings have plummeted to a 5-year low. This is during a period of time that nobody even describes as a recession. The same venture capitalists who funded the AI boom keep insisting that these trends are about macroeconomic abstractions like interest rates, a stark contrast to their rhetoric the rest of the time, when they insist that they are alpha males who make their own decisions based on their strong convictions and brave stances against woke culture. It is, in fact, the case that they are just greedy people who invested a ton of money into trying to put a lot of good people out of work, and they succeeded in doing so.</p>\\n<p>There is no reason why AI tools like this couldn\\'t be used in the way that they\\'re often described, where they increase productivity and enable workers to do more and generate more value. But instead we have the wealthiest people in the world telling the wealthiest companies in the world, while they generate record profits, to lay off workers who could be creating cool things for customers, and then blaming it on everyone but themselves.</p>\\nThe past as prison\\n<p>Then there\u2019s the second problem raised by vibe coding: You can\u2019t make anything truly radical with it. By definition, LLMs are trained on what has come before. In addition to being already-discovered territory, existing code is buggy and broken and sloppy and, as anyone who has ever written code knows, absolutely embarrassing to look at. Worse, many of the people who are using vibe coding tools are increasingly those who don\u2019t understand the code that is being generated by these systems. This means the people generating all of this newly-vibed code won\u2019t even know when the output is insecure, or will perform poorly, or includes exploits that let others take over their system, or when it is simply incoherent nonsense that looks like code but doesn\u2019t do anything.</p>\\n<p>All of those factors combine to encourage people to think of vibe coding tools as a sort of \u201cblack box\u201d that just spits out an app for you. Even the giant tech companies are starting to encourage this mindset, tacitly endorsing the idea that people don\u2019t need to know what their systems are doing under the hood. But obviously, somebody needs to know whether a system is actually secure. Somebody needs to know if a system is actually doing the tasks it says that it\u2019s doing. The Big AI companies that make the most popular LLMs on the market today routinely design their products to induce emotional dependency in users by giving them positive feedback and encouragement, even when that requires generating false responses. Put more simply: they make the bot lie to you to make you feel good so you use the AI more. That\u2019s terrible in a million ways, but one of them is that it sure does generate some bad code.</p>\\n<p>And a vibe coding tool absolutely won\u2019t make something truly new. The most radical, disruptive, interesting, surprising, weird, fun innovations in technology have happened because people with a strange compulsion to do something cool had enough knowledge to get their code out into the world. The World Wide Web itself was not a huge technological leap over what came before \u2014 it took off because of a huge leap in insight into human nature and human behavior, that happened to be captured in code. The actual bits and bytes? They were mostly just plain text, much of which was in formats that had already been around for many years prior to Tim Berners-Lee assembling it all into the first web browser. That kind of surprising innovation could probably never be vibe coded, even though all of the raw materials might be scooped up by an LLM, because even if the human writing the prompt had that counterintuitive stroke of genius, the system would still be hemmed in by the constraints of the works it had been trained on. The past is a prison when you\u2019re inventing the future.</p>\\n<p>What\u2019s more, if you were going to use a vibe coding tool to make a truly radical new technology, do you think today\u2019s Big AI companies would let their systems create that app? The same companies that made a platform that just put hundreds of thousands of coders out of work? The  same companies that make a platform that tells your kids to end their own lives? The same companies whose cronies in the White House are saying there should never be any laws reining them in? Those folks are going to help you make new tech that threatens to disrupt their power? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\\nPutting power in people\u2019s hands\\n<p>I\u2019m deeply torn about what the future of LLMs for coding should be. I\u2019ve spent decades of my life trying to make it easier for everyone to make software. I\u2019ve seen, firsthand, the power of using AI tools to help coders \u2014 especially those new to coding \u2014\\xa0build their confidence in being able to create something new. I love that potential, and in many ways, it\u2019s the most positive and optimistic possibility around LLMs that I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s the thing that makes me think that maybe there is a part of all the AI hype that is not pure bullshit. Especially if we can find a version of these tools that\u2019s genuinely open source and free and has been trained on people\u2019s code with their consent and cooperation, perhaps in collaboration with some educational institutions, I\u2019d be delighted to see that shared with the world in a thoughtful way.</p>\\n<p>But I also have seen the majority of the working coders I know (and the non-working coders I know, including myself) rush to integrate the commercial coding assistants from the Big AI companies into their workflow without necessarily giving proper consideration to the long-term implications of that choice. What happens when we\u2019ve developed our dependencies on that assistance? How will people introduce new technologies like new programming languages and frameworks if we all consider the LLMs to be the canonical way of writing our code, and the training models don\u2019t know the new tech exists? How does our imagination shrink when we consider our options of what we create with code to be choosing between the outputs of the LLM rather than starting from the blank slate of our imagination? How will we build the next generation of coders skilled enough to catch the glaring errors that LLMs create in their code?</p>\\n<p>There\u2019s never been this stark a contrast between the negatives and positives of a new technology being so tightly coupled before when it comes to enabling developers. Generally change comes to coders incrementally. Historically, there was always a (wonderful!) default skepticism to coding culture, where anything that reeked of marketing or hype was looked at with a huge amount of doubt until there was a significant amount of proof to back it up.</p>\\n<p>But in recent years, as with everything else, the culture wars have come for tech. There\u2019s now a cohort in the coding world that has adopted a cult of personality around a handful of big tech tycoons despite the fact that these men are deeply corrosive to society. Or perhaps because they are. As a result, there\u2019s a built-in constituency for any new AI tool, regardless of its negative externalities, which gives them a sense of momentum even where there may not be any.</p>\\n<p>It\u2019s worth us examining what\u2019s really going on, and articulating explicitly what we\u2019re trying to enable. Who are we trying to empower? What does success look like? What do we want people to be able to build? What do we not want people to be able to make? What price is too high to pay? What convenience is not worth the cost?</p>\\nWhat tools do we choose?\\n<p>I do, still, believe deeply in the power of technology to empower people. I believe firmly that you have to understand how to create technology if you want to understand how to control it. And I still believe that we have to democratize the power to create and control technology to as many people as possible so that technology can be something people can use as a tool, rather than something that happens _to_them.</p>\\n<p>We are now in a complex phase, though, where the promise of democratizing access to creating technology is suddenly fraught in a way that it has never been before. The answer can\u2019t possibly be that technology remains inaccessible and difficult for those outside of a privileged class, and easy for those who are already comfortable in the existing power structure.</p>\\n<p>A lot is still very uncertain, but I come back to one key question that helps me frame the discussion of what\u2019s next: What\u2019s the most radical app that we could build? And which tools will enable me to build it? Even if all we can do is start having a more complicated conversation about what we\u2019re doing when we\u2019re vibe coding, we\u2019ll be making progress towards a more empowered future.</p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:11</p>"},{"location":"anildash.com/What%20about%20%E2%80%9CNothing%20about%20us%20without%20us-%E2%80%9D/","title":"What about \u201cNothing about us without us?\u201d","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: anildash.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: https://anildash.com/2025/12/08/what-about-nothing-about-us/</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>As I was drafting my last piece on Friday, \u201cThey have to be able to talk about us without us\u201d, my thoughts of course went to one of the most famous slogans of the disability rights movement, \u201cNothing about us without us.\u201d I wasn\u2019t unaware that there were similarities in the phrasing of what I wrote. But I think the topic of communicating effectively to groups, as I wrote about the other day, and ensuring that disabled people are centered in disability advocacy, are such different subjects that I didn\u2019t want to just quickly gloss over the topic in a sidebar of a larger piece. They\\'re very distinct topics that really only share a few words in common.</p>\\n<p>One of the great joys of becoming friends with a number of really thoughtful and experienced disability rights activists over the last several years has been their incredible generosity in teaching me about so much of the culture and history of the movements that they\u2019ve built their work upon, and one of the most powerful slogans has been that refrain of \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d.</p>\\n<p>Here I should start by acknowledging Alice Wong, who we recently lost, who founded the Disability Visibility Project, and a MacArthur Fellow, and a tireless and inventive advocate for everyone in the disabled community. She was one of the first people to bring me in to learning about this history and these movements, more than a decade ago. She was also a patient and thoughtful teacher, and over our many conversations over the years, she did more than anyone else in my life to truly personify the spirit of \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d by fighting to ensure that disabled people led the work to make the world accessible for all. If you have the chance, learn about her work, and support it.</p>\\n<p>But a key inflection point in my own understanding of \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d came, unsurprisingly, in the context of how disabled people have been interacting with technology. I used to host a podcast called Function, and we did an episode about how inaccessible so much of contemporary technology has become, and how that kind of ruins things for everyone. (The episode is still up on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.)  We had on Emily Ladau of The Accessible Stall podcast, Alex Haagaard of The Disabled List, and Vilissa Thompson of Ramp Your Voice. It\u2019s well worth a listen, and Emily, Alex and Vilissa really do an amazing job of pointing to really specific, really evocative examples of obvious places where today\u2019s tech world could be so much more useful and powerful for everyone if its creators were making just a few simple changes.</p>\\n<p>What\u2019s striking to me now, listening to that conversation six years later, is how little has changed from the perspective of the technology world, but also how much my own lived experience has come to reflect so much of what I learned in those conversations.</p>\\n<p>Each of them was the \"us\" in the conversation, using their own personal experience, and the experience of other disabled people that they were in community with, to offer specific and personal insights that the creators of these technologies did not have. And whether it was for reasons of crass commercial opportunism \u2014 here\\'s some money you could be making! \u2014\\xa0or simply because it was the right thing to do morally, it\\'s obvious that the people making these technologies could benefit by honoring the principle of centering these users of their products.</p>\\nTaking our turn\\n<p>I\u2019ve had this conversation on various social media channels in a number of ways over the years, but another key part of understanding the \u201cus\u201d in \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d when it comes to disability, is that the \u201cus\u201d is all of us, in time. It\\'s very hard for many people who haven\u2019t experienced it to understand that everyone should be accommodated and supported, because everyone is disabled; it\u2019s only a question of when and for how long.</p>\\n<p>In contemporary society, we\u2019re given all kinds of justifications for why we can\u2019t support everyone\u2019s needs, but so much of those are really grounded in simply trying to convince ourselves that a disabled person is someone else, an \u201cother\u201d who isn\u2019t worthy or deserving of our support. I think deep down, everyone knows better. It\u2019s just that people who don\u2019t (yet) identify as disabled don\u2019t really talk about it very much.</p>\\n<p>In reality, we\\'ll all be disabled. Maybe you\\'re in a moment of respite from it, or in that brief window before the truth of the inevitability of it has been revealed to you (sorry, spoiler warning!), but it\\'s true for all of us \u2014\\xa0even when it\\'s not visible. That means all of us have to default to supporting and uplifting and empowering the people who are disabled today. This was the key lesson that I didn\u2019t really get personally until I started listening to those who were versed in the history and culture of disability advocacy, about how the patronizing solutions were often harmful, or competing for resources with the right answers.</p>\\n<p>I\u2019ve had my glimpses of this myself. Back in 2021, I had Lyme disease. I didn\u2019t get it as bad as some, but it did leave me physically and mentally unable to function as I had been used to, for several months. I had some frame of reference for physical weakness; I could roughly compare it to a bad illness like the flu, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly the same. But a diminished mental capacity was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and was profoundly unsettling, deeply challenging my sense of self. After the incident I\u2019d described in 2022, I had a series of things to recover from physically and mentally that also presented a significant challenge, but were especially tough because so much of people\u2019s willingness to accommodate others is based on any disability being visible. Anything that\u2019s not immediately perceived at a superficial level, or legible to a stranger in a way that\u2019s familiar to them, is generally dismissed or seen as invalid for support.</p>\\n<p>I point all of this out not to claim that I fully understand the experience of those who live with truly serious disabilities, or to act as if I know what it\u2019s been like for those who have genuinely worked to advocate for disabled people. Instead, I think it can often be useful to show how porous the boundary is between people who don\u2019t think of themselves as disabled and those who already know that they are. And of course this does not mean that people who aren\\'t currently disabled can speak on behalf of those who are \u2014 that\\'s the whole point of \"nothing about us without us\"! \u2014\\xa0but rather to point out that the time to begin building your empathy and solidarity is now, not when you suddenly have the realization that you\\'re part of the community.</p>\\nEverything about us\\n<p>There\u2019s a righteous rage that underlies the cry of \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d, stemming from so many attempts to address the needs of disabled people having come from those outside the community, arriving with plans that ranged from inept to evil. We\u2019re in a moment when the authoritarians in charge in so much of the world are pushing openly-eugenicist agendas that will target disabled people first amongst the many vulnerable populations that they\u2019ll attempt to attack. Challenging economic times like the one we\u2019re in affect disabled people significantly harder as the job market disproportionately shrinks in opportunities for the disabled first.</p>\\n<p>So it\u2019s going to take all of us standing in solidarity to ensure that the necessary advocacy and support are in place for what promises to be an extraordinarily difficult moment. But I take some solace and inspiration from the fact that there are so many disabled people who have provided us with the clear guidance and leadership we need to navigate this moment. And there is simple guidance we can follow when doing so to ensure that we\u2019re centering the right leaders, by listening to those who said, \u201cnothing about us without us.\u201d</p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:11</p>"},{"location":"antirez.com/","title":"antirez.com","text":"<p>\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>Automatic programming 20260131</li> </ul> <p>\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u7531 OpenClaw \u81ea\u52a8\u6293\u53d6</p>"},{"location":"antirez.com/Automatic%20programming_20260131/","title":"Automatic programming","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: antirez.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:25:27 +0100 \u94fe\u63a5: http://antirez.com/news/159</p> <p>In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just \"the process of writing software\", I believe) with the term \"Automatic Programming\".  In case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.  Please, stop saying \"Claude vibe coded this software for me\". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.  When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software you are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.  That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, what to do.  I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.  If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.  Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).

Sometimes the blueprints for the best version of the future already exist in the past, but only if you do some spelunking first, and remixing second. Those who read history will be able to repeat it, but under better circumstances, or more stellar execution. Technology history means visiting tech museums, and I have been doing that for decades now. I wanted to reflect on why I love some of them more than the others, so I made this photo essay: six best tech museums I\u2019ve been to, 16 great ones\u2026 and, at the end, three not-as-positive examples. I wrote it mostly for myself to think about what museums mean for me and what makes for the best museum experiences, but perhaps you will find something in it, too.

The best tech museums that I\u2019ve been to National Railway Museum Park /\u00a0Taipei\u00a0Railway Workshop Taiwan (the site near Songshan Park)\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2025 / nrm.gov.tw This place blew me away. It\u2019s a newish museum, but hosted in an old, massive railway workshop building complex, so you know the space itself is going to be part of the story \u2013 locomotives, huge industrial cranes that lift them around, various bits and pieces of preserved machinery. I generally love this kind of a vibe (even the smell of it all) and find it, in a way, breathtaking. Part of me would choose to live here in an instant. But, there are more things that make this museum special. A snippet of one of the videos The production value is impeccable and it seems to be spent on things that matter. For example, there are absolutely magnificent videos here of men restoring old locomotives, presented on big vertical displays. They\u2019re transfixing, almost pornographic. But they still feel made by someone who cares about this stuff and wants to show it well, and not just show it off . The landmark exhibit here is a multimedia piece with a huge transparent screen occasionally moving by an important locomotive, showing its innards. It\u2019s a lavish, impressive animation, with huge thumping bass and 3D renders\u2026 maybe a bit too cinematic, but again: it feels like it\u2019s coming from the right place. Trains are amazing and underrated, and they deserve awe. Generally, there\u2019s a lot of pride around here, and it feels like the right flavor of pride. In many exhibits, one can sense how people care about restoring the old machines and telling their stories, how the railways mattered to Taiwan, how important this preservation of history as a concept is to people here. Flanking the big building with amazing sightlines are some smaller, more traditional exhibits. The focus seems to be a bit more on the cultural aspects of railways, and less on the tech side. I learned so much from it all. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic blend of old and new, with thoughtful details. It\u2019s big and inspiring enough I came back again a week later. There are many other disused buildings around the refurbished one that haven\u2019t been touched yet, and I understand the aspiration is to turn it into almost a park of sorts. I hope I\u2019ll be back to check out how they\u2019re doing. In a few rooms that have vintage phones as part of showing old offices or ticket booths, those phones occasionally ring. I found that so delightful. Museu de la T\u00e8cnica de\u00a0l\u2019Empord\u00e0 Figueres, Spain\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2016 and 2022 / mte.cat This was perhaps my best museum experience ever \u2013 the right thing at the right time in an unexpected place and with unexpected intensity. This thread captured the story, and I reflected upon it later here . So yeah, I\u2019m biased, but the reasons for that bias are worth celebrating. This museum definitely belongs to the joint category of \u201cgreat collection\u201d + \u201cgreat passion,\u201d with so many typewriters you could sometimes even pause and trace the history of individual manufacturer, as all of their models are shown side by side like on a timeline. There\u2019s also something I always appreciate: the ephemera. It\u2019s not just typewriters, but also the desks, the accessories, the advertisements, the complementary devices.            There is a risk of a museum doing that kind of stuff in a way that feels like hoarding and I don\u2019t fully understand yet what separates one from the other. This museum is not an extreme time capsule like other museums can be, but I find the ephemera crucial to understanding the machines. Nothing, after all, is used in isolation, and no device can be removed from the context of its time and its surroundings. I quip sometimes that the only difference between collecting and hoarding are the stories. I\u2019m also very happy I got to briefly meet the creator of the museum (and his whole family) before his passing. ACMI Melbourne\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2024 / acmi.net.au My photos won\u2019t do ACMI justice. This is an extremely well-made museum, filled with great experiences and stories. Every exhibit here drips with creativity, from simple ideas like splitting a car in half with two well-placed mirrors, or miniatures of TV rooms held inside actual TVs. There are probably fifty great little details here that will make you happy even if you don\u2019t notice them, and are a proof that a museum is so much more than its collection. Even the applications of technology are wonderful and exemplary. This isn\u2019t a museum where you\u2019d encounter a piece of paper saying \u201cunder maintenance\u201d slapped atop a stock Android tablet. For example, there is one exhibit here where you can edit a video by moving wooden blocks: Upon entry, you get a cool artifact resembling a View-Master reel where you \u201ccollect\u201d interesting information by tapping on things; most museums would screw this up somehow, and here it works flawlessly and the interactions are delightful. It feels the way we want tech to be \u2013  serving and enhancing, integrated, reliable, in the background. ACMI\u2019s Lens in use: \u201ccollecting\u201d artifacts, and at a meta exhibit where you can see connections between things you collected You can tell the museum is run by a designer! This is all really creative and endlessly inspiring. Top of my list. My strict travel plans meant I only visited once, and I regret it, as\u00a0I feel I only scratched the surface. Computer\u00adspiele\u00admuseum /\u00a0Computer\u00a0Game Museum Berlin\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2018 / computerspielemuseum.de This museum punches above its weight. Most videogame museums I\u2019ve seen are vehicles for hollow nostalgia, arcades by a different name. But Berlin\u2019s Computer Game Museum has more depth and tries to do the art and history of videogames justice. There is a little arcade here, for sure, even styled appropriately and with a cute list of highscores. There are also a few nicely recreated \u201cteenager\u201d rooms matching different decades. But there are also rare prototypes of local games (like the East Germany\u2019s Poly-Play ), and some art pieces like PainStation , ROM CHECK FAIL , and the world\u2019s worst Pac-Man made even worse by attaching it to a comically oversized Atari joystick (shoes off!). The selection of games continues to be surprising elsewhere: Would you expect to see Stanley Parable here? Or ELIZA? The design of the place is also interesting. There\u2019s always something around the corner that catches your attention, sometimes with the rooms and machines complimenting each other visually. This museum made me think. Really nicely done. I wrote a thread on social if you are curious to learn a bit more. Bonami Spel\u00adComputer Museum Zwolle, The Netherlands\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2022 / computermuseum.nl In the 2000s, the Computer History Museum \u2019s then-new location had an interim state called The Visible Storage: raw shelves, filled with computers. There were some plaques, but most stories came from volunteer docents (I eventually became one of them) running the show. The Dutch Bonami museum is that, except there are no docents. Oh, and the whole place is massive . I have never seen this many microcomputers under one roof. Not even close. I think there must be thousands of computers here, and it\u2019s funny how just the scale alone elevates the museum. Without that scale, there would be so much room for improvement. Turn on more of these computers so you can play with them (currently, only a scant few are allowed this). Tell better stories. Add production value. But turns out, sometimes scale is enough. Enter Bonami and you feel awash in microcomputers, surrounded by what feels like the entirety of the 1980s and the 1990s. You can compare small differences between models, ponder design details, find obscure machines you didn\u2019t know existed. It\u2019s worth checking it out to see how this amount of computers makes you feel. Home\u00adComputer\u00adMuseum Helmond, The Netherlands\u00a0/\u00a0Visited in 2022 / homecomputermuseum.nl Perhaps an apotheosis of a certain kind of a computer museum: all microcomputers, some turned on, catering to nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s. There\u2019s nothing bad about this approach, but many places do that and after a while it all feels kind of same\u2019y. Not here. Many of the machines here are in working condition and ready to play, which is already very nice. And there will be a few surprises: restoring a Dutch graphics computer Aesthedes with an impressive island of a keyboard , a few Dutch machines like the distinctively shaped Holborn and Eindhoven\u2019s CHE-1, or a \u201ctime machine\u201d 1990 Tulip computer that allows you to browse the internet like it appeared decades ago. The design and decor are slightly better than elsewhere, too, with various thematic displays, and an open, welcoming feel \u2013 and generally it feels the museum is cared for in a way many are not.

Polish state television had then but two sorry channels, so there was little actual competition. Although it would soon be gone , communism meant scant advertising. And TV in general wasn\u2019t nearly as precious about on-air saturation as it is today \u2014 meaning there were no multiple commercial breaks, no ads for future programs infringing on current programs, and no end credits sped up spastically to make room for the next item on the breathless, never-to-be-halted schedule. My childhood TV had none of those things. In Poland, in the 1980s, the dead space in between programs was filled with\u2026 a clock. Or, to me, The Clock. This was still before the digital age, so The Clock must have been put together by hand, hung on one of the walls of the television headquarters at Jana Paw\u0142a Woronicza Street in Warsaw, and assigned the saddest of cameras which permanently, year after year, kept pointing at its face. It was a minimalistic clock, with three off-white hands, and \u2014 for today\u2019s standards \u2014 an oddly small Telewizja Polska logo. The background was dark blue. There were no sound effects or music. Recently, I learned this is what insiders call \u201ca clock ident.\u201d Clock idents were popular in other countries in Europe and Asia , and still exist in random pockets of our planet as an odd, half-forgotten tradition, similar to striking clocks mounted in towers. There\u2019s something calming, almost meditative, imagining it being broadcast to millions of people at the same time; it ties neatly into the queue reality of countries in similar situation to Poland. Recordings of clock idents from Japan , Russia , Australia , Chile , Denmark (don\u2019t forget the fish!), and Czechoslovakia I didn\u2019t have any of that context then. Back then, I simply loved The Clock to death. Not for what it was, of course (time-telling was provided by our own wall clock that didn\u2019t require aerials and cathode ray tubes \u2014 and later on, a prized Casio electronic watch on my wrist). Like Pavlov\u2019s dogs, I loved The Clock for what it promised . I would stare at it just minutes before new adventures of Crockett and Tubbs . I would twiddle my thumbs in anticipation of the resolution to last week\u2019s Crime Story \u2014 or, in the years before I was allowed to watch those series, another episode of a Polish, Czech, or Russian cartoon. The Clock was not unlike that Universal Studios globe , a reliable entry gate to a new grand adventure, but one that didn\u2019t require an expensive trip to the movie theatre. It was right there, in my home. I remembered The Clock in 2015 as I was preparing a San Francisco event where I subtitled a vintage Polish TV show and showed it to my friends. And, of course, always at the ready for idiosyncratic long-tail interests, YouTube had a video of a VHS recording of The Clock , complete with that annoying beeping message meant to wake you up to turn off your TV after the programs ended (again, weird on so many levels today). So, just as I sometimes do with other artifacts of my youth, I recreated The Clock in JavaScript. And I had a little d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: I remember having programmed a version of that clock once already, on an early computer of mine. I wish it was possible for that me, from 25 years ago, and me from 2 weeks ago, to have a conversation: programmer to programmer, one of us deliberately tapping into nostalgia and skeuomorphism, one of us simply believing in magic and trying to summon it by whichever means possible. (Although perhaps that encounter would end just as badly as this experiment .) In the years since I pieced together a few details. After seeing almost exactly the same clock in Japan in 2018 \u2013 in a physical form \u2013 I realized the TVP clock must have been imported from there. The Polish TV clock wasn\u2019t really Polish! And recently, I learned at least one person recreated a host of beautiful BBC clock idents the same way. But the YouTube videos and the new discoveries don\u2019t intrude on my little fantasy. So, check out that clock recreation above or below. To many of you it might mean very little. To some, it will bring back memories. And if you\u2019re like me, you will remember that little delay between the second hand hitting a full-minute mark, and the operator starting the playback of whatever was supposed to go on air. That blink of an 1980s eye, filled with excitement and anticipation, will too be your favourite nerdy childhood moment, one you never knew you so appreciated. This is a JavaScript clock and should be showing your current time. You can open it as a standalone thing .</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:13</p>"},{"location":"aresluna.org/The%20day%20Return%20became%20Enter/","title":"The day Return became Enter","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: aresluna.org \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: https://aresluna.org/the-day-return-became-enter</p> <p>The day Return became Enter In the popular imagination, the transition from the world of typewriters to the universe of computers was orderly and simple: at some point in the 20th century, someone attached a CPU and a screen to a typewriter, and that turned it into a computer. But the reality is much more fascinating and convoluted. The transition was meandering and lengthy, and traces of its many battles and decisions remain scattered across keyboards today. And no key might better represent the complexity of that journey than the Return key. Return and Enter keys on a AT&amp;T keyboard, and a carriage return on a typewriter An assembly line of typewriters under construction at the Underwood plant in 1962, with the carriage return levers clearly visible Typewriters, born in the 1870s, did not understand information, and didn\u2019t care about the meaning of their output. Early models lacked 0 and 1 keys for cost cutting reasons. You were supposed to type a capital O or a lowercase l instead \u2013\u00a0they looked just about good enough. Teachers and tutorials encouraged you to overprint to create missing characters: type I on top of S to get a dollar sign, for example, or even reach for a pencil to fill in a missing part if overtyping wasn\u2019t good enough. In theory, you could go even further: nothing prevented you from grabbing a typewritten page, putting it back upside down, and typing on top of what you wrote before. This technique added to the repertoire of an art form known as \u201cconcrete poetry.\u201d In that universe, a carriage return \u2013 that distinctive lever on the left-hand side of each typewriter \u2013 was a kind of mechanical shorthand. It advanced the paper by a line or two, and returned the carriage to the left margin, winding it for the next line. You could carry out those two functions separately, but even early typewriter manufacturers realized the operation needed a better, joint interface. An evolution of the carriage return lever: from 1901 to the 1950s The carriage return lever was similar to all the other mechanical functions of the typewriter, starting as simple as humanly (and inhumanly) possible. Tab added a few spaces or mechanically zipped the carriage to the next predetermined point. The Shift key moved the carriage up or the key basket down, applying its simple operation to every key equally. Shift Lock was a literal tooth holding Shift in place, placed right next to it for manufacturing convenience first, and ergonomics a distant second. It affected letters, digits, and punctuation in equal measure, in contrast to the later Caps Lock . Improperly set up tabs could damage the typewriter as the entire energy of the line was released immediately. In later typewriters, a tab brake that remedied the problem became a standard feature. A demonstration station for a Burroughs typewriter with an electric carriage return, 1936 Some of these special keys started as levers or even, like Tab , first-party or third-party additions bolted onto your typewriter. In time, all these functions migrated to the keyboard, making them easier to reach and more consistent in their operation. But carriage return remained the one holdover, too mechanically complex to follow in the other functions\u2019 footsteps. It was only when typewriters embraced electricity in the 1940s and 1950s that the carriage return completed its transformation into a key, and the distinctive lever could be detached. The key was most often called Carriage Return or Return , as expected. But since introducing electricity made the carriage return so much easier to operate, it was no surprise that the industry that once brought you Floating Shift and Magic Margin keys also saw some typewriter manufacturers calling their keys Electric Return or even Power Return , like doors in your shiny new Detroit-made car. The most popular electric typewriter in history, the IBM Selectric, called it \u201ccarrier return\u201d in the user manual \u2013\u00a0the carriage was stationary, and the font ball was carried across it \u2013 but the keyboard itself went with a simple Return . In the 1960s, an experiment estimated that switching to an electric typewriter made regular typing 18 times easier on average. Pressing the spacebar required only about half the work on an electric, since it was already pretty easy on a mechanical typewriter. Backspace needed 12 times less effort on an electric typewriter, and Shift 9 times. But the introduction of the Carriage Return key was measured to be an astonishing 425 times easier on people\u2019s fingers. In an interesting reversal of the early days of carriage returns, cheaper models of Smith-Corona typewriters from the 1970s came with most functions electrified except for the carriage return, negative space for the key appearing on the keyboard, and the lever still attached in a typical space. Note one typewriter using the early Dvorak layout, including reordered digits. But there were other keyboards that embraced electricity even earlier without bragging about it. Those were the keyboards of teletypes, taught to send text across wires (\u201cteletype\u201d derived from \u201cteletypewriter,\u201d or \u201cremote typewriter\u201d) at a constant speed of a little over 6 characters per second. Teletypes formed pre-internet information networks, used by news agencies, postal offices, railroads, and other big companies and institutions. They were a successor to Morse code, abandoning its iconic single key that was pressed repeatedly to create streams of dihs and dahs. What replaced a Morse code lever was, at first, the five-key Baud\u00f4t keyboard, and then a standard typewriter-like QWERTY keyboard, the general public\u2019s familiarity with which ensured less training was required. Using a QWERTY keyboard meant the machines had to be tasked with encoding. Every key was assigned a number from 0 to 31. Space was zero, A was 3, B was 25, C was 14, and so on \u2013\u00a0teletypes knew how to encode all of the characters being typed in, and how to decode them on the other side. This was an approach later built on by ASCII in the 1960s (encoding 128 numbers) and Unicode in the 1990s (encoding 150 thousand at the time of writing). But for proper operation, it wasn\u2019t just letters and digits that needed to be transmitted. Everything else \u2013 spaces, backspaces, jumping to a new line \u2013 also had to travel across the wire, to make sure the reconstructed message matched the input like a carbon copy would. Those extra pieces of information were eventually named \u201ccontrol characters,\u201d and assigned their own codes. But there was a problem. Typing a letter, moving back, and advancing paper took relatively little time. However, zipping the carriage from the right side of the page to the left was slower. That created a challenge: since teletypes communicated at a constant rate, the first letter arriving after a longer line could be smeared across the page, as the carriage return was still in progress. Just as with early typewriters, any \u201csmart\u201d solution would be prohibitively complicated or expensive to make. But what if the character following a carriage return was guaranteed to be non-printing? This would give the teletype a chance to catch up. And so teletypes undid the early convenience of typewriters, and Carriage Return became decoupled from Line Feed . The former key moved the carriage to the left, but stayed on the same line. The latter advanced the paper to the next line, with no horizontal movement. Sometimes, the Line Feed code would arrive after a carriage return was complete. Other times, it would come in the middle of the carriage returning, but the teletype could deal with those movements coexisting. This is the origin of the CR/LF debacle that\u2019s still an occasional problem for today\u2019s programmers. The responsibility now rested on a typist to press these two keys every time, and in that particular order. This was a solution to a weird challenge that was both smart and dumb \u2013 and it was the first, but far from the last, complication around Return . In another corner of the typing universe, the word-processing revolution was brewing. Early word processors \u2013 back when that phrase meant hardware, not software \u2013 were nothing more than automated typewriters, teletypes without wires. But they focused on solving a slightly different issue: not one of exchange of information, but one of copying and rewriting. The first word processors allowed people to \u201csave\u201d a page\u2019s worth of keystrokes that could later be replayed. The letters were initially stored on hole-filled cards \u2013 not dissimilar to player pianos \u2013 and later captured onto magnetic media. The automatic repetition had two huge benefits: You could create carbon copies that were of the same quality, and you could also create personalized advertising letters, ones that looked as if they were typed just for the recipient. After mastering that, the inventors of word processors moved on to the next, even bigger challenge. With typewriters, making a single typo or having a belated desire to change anything usually meant throwing out what one had typed so far and retyping the page from the beginning. But what if new technology allowed you to freely modify the saved text? Would it be possible to replace one word with another? Or delete a word? Or insert a sentence? There were many, many problems to solve here: storage, logic, user interface. One of them? The na\u00efve carriage return struggled to find its place in the world of word processing. What was necessary was text reflow : automatically adjusting the text and inserting carriage returns (or even hyphenating) whenever a word was about to go past the right margin. And then revisiting those breaks the moment anything was changed, inserted, or deleted. This eventually led to the Insert key, originally used to switch between old-school, typewriter-like overtyping, and the new shiny method of inserting text as you typed. The key was designed to help with a specific transition, and then did something few keys do: it disappeared from most keyboar</p> <p>...

To his credit, there was a lot to hate. The layout seemed random, with letters strewn around without rhyme or reason. Watching someone type on it felt painful: fingers flailed wildly all over the place, common letters far away from the home row necessitated more travel, and there were long stretches of one hand doing all the work while the other sat idle. Adding insult to injury, it wasn\u2019t even really that difficult to spot someone using a QWERTY-wearing typewriter. The layout was already so ubiquitous, it was known as \u201cthe universal keyboard.\u201d But he felt it didn\u2019t deserve to be. \u201cIt would be difficult to design a key-board over which the hands must travel farther,\u201d he said. There was nothing smart about it; QWERTY \u201cwas not arranged on any principle, but resulted from the necessity of humoring the construction of the early machine.\u201d He wanted to build a principled keyboard instead. Eventually, after much deliberation, he did so. He arranged the most common letters in one row, so the hands didn\u2019t have to leave it except for rarer letters, which represented only 30% of characters typed: \u201cThe hands travel over the least possible distance. Almost all word endings are close to the spacebar.\u201d Switching to the new keyboard would save 15% of typing time, and the training wouldn\u2019t take long. The keyboard \u201ccan be memorized and high speed attained on it in one-quarter the time required for the Universal.\u201d It was a great keyboard with a great layout. He could\u2019ve called it by his name \u2013 George C. Blickensderfer \u2013 but he had a better one. If the other keyboard was Universal, his would be Scientific. The Scientific keyboard was unveiled in 1893 at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, attached to a few brand-new typewriters. Those were named after him. Blickensderfer Model 1 was the fully featured model, with some other interesting ideas: an implement for easier line-drawing, automatic word spacing, and extra keys like The , And , and Other that output short words. There was a simpler version, the Model 3, and even the tiny Model 5 had a few interesting features: instead of swinging typebars, it had a type wheel that would rotate when a typist pressed keys. The wheel could be swapped out, which meant you could easily type in many different fonts, and in many different languages. All three typewriters were fascinating, and Blickensderfer already had a track record of being an inventor that knew how to follow through. But he could not afford more than a small booth at an exposition of twenty-two other typewriter manufacturers \u2013 and bad luck would put his right next to Remington\u2019s lavish display. Little did he know in 1893 that the rest of his career would be defined by bad luck, too. The high hopes for Model 1 never materialized \u2013 all the interest and preorders went towards the dirt-cheap, minuscule Model 5. Not that it was bad, of course. The typewriter gained an affectionate nickname: \u201cBlick 5,\u201d or \u201cthe five-pound secretary.\u201d It was a bit clumsy, but also portable and affordable. It struck an interesting balance of features and set a price point between cheap, cumbersome index typewriters, and big-featured desktop machines like Remington\u2019s. \u201cThere are few old typewriters with as much charm,\u201d mentioned one collector more recently. Blickensderfer \u21165 in its case. Courtesy Martin Howard Blickensderfer wasn\u2019t done inventing by then. His later, fascinating Blick Oriental could not only type in two alphabets, but one of them \u2013 Hebrew \u2013 printed right to left. In 1902, he created one of the first electric typewriters in history, the Blickensderfer Electric. And then, there was also the Niagara \u2013 a typewriter that produced coded messages, aimed at the lucrative diplomatic and military markets. In an alternate universe, all of them matured and became product lines that set the tone of the industry for decades. But not in this one. The Oriental was great, but it had limited market appeal. The Electric appeared too early when people were still unaccustomed to electricity. The Niagara\u2019s cipher, advertised as unbreakable and purportedly built over the course of nine years, was cracked within twenty-four hours by a government code expert. The Scientific keyboard wasn\u2019t having that much luck, either. The layout, also known as DHIA\u00adTENSOR \u2013 named for the bottom row of home keys holding the most popular vowels and consonants right under the typist\u2019s fingertips \u2013 proved unpopular with customers already used to QWERTY. Four years after its introduction, Blickensderfer began offering an option to furnish his typewriters with the dreaded, unprincipled universal keyboard. (A rumor started that he even requested such customers to sign a release claiming he wasn\u2019t liable for any bad consequences of using QWERTY.) A few years later, he was forced to go further, offering an option to convert a Scientific keyboard to a Universal for a mere six dollars. This option was presented in the catalog with a wistful and never exercised \u201cor vice versa.\u201d And even then, Blickensderfer backed the wrong horse, his QWERTY machines equipped with three banks of keys and two rows, a combination already losing the Shift Wars on people\u2019s desks. The adoption of touch typing and the runaway success of the Underwood would soon cement four banks as the only viable option \u2013 and just when Blickensderfer introduced that, too, World War I stopped his production and killed all the exports of the prior machines. The final nail in the coffin was a new portable entrant, the Corona 3, that took away most of the domestic market. Blickensderfer \u21166 typewriters with Scientific and QWERTY keyboards Courtesy Martin Howard and Bwilson888 George Blickensderfer\u2019s military inventions kept the company going through the Great War, but he himself did not see the end of it. He died in 1917. In the words of one of the historians, his passing \u201cripped the heart out of the company.\u201d The production of most of the machines ended then. In 1921, Remington, the company whose fair booth dwarfed the introduction of his first three typewriters \u2013 and the creator of the Universal keyboard \u2013 bought the factory and the patents. After 28 years, the dream of the Scientific Key-Board was gone. 2 Stop me if you\u2019ve heard any of the following claims before. QWERTY was completely random, put together without any thought. Or, if there was any reasoning behind it, it was just putting all the letters necessary to spell T-Y-P-E-W-R-I-T-E-R in the top row, to make it easy to wow customers. How about this version: QWERTY was built to slow the typist down as the early typewriters could not handle high typing speeds, attained by moving frequent pairs of letters as far away as possible. QWERTY was, basically, the worst layout possible. It was built without any ergonomic considerations. It wasn\u2019t great for touch typing. I bet you also heard of the keyboard layout that was the opposite of all the above \u2013 the mythical Dvorak keyboard. It was just what Blickensderfer once wanted, only even better. It was the perfect layout , put together with thought and care. It was efficient and comfortable. It was made for touch typing. It allowed the typists to reach 180wpm, fast enough to write down people\u2019s words as they were speaking . But it wasn\u2019t undone by bad luck \u2013 it was sabotaged by typewriter companies and typewriter teachers. Or, if it wasn\u2019t, it was still better than QWERTY, and the market treated it unfairly. The fact that none of us type on a Dvorak today is one of the keyboard universe\u2019s biggest injustices. Some of those arguments are true, some not. Funnily enough, many of them are neither . Let\u2019s unpeel the QWERTY and Dvorak myths and understand why the story is much more complicated than it appears, and much more interesting than most people give it credit for. The first challenge: neither Sholes nor any of his inner-circle compatriots wrote a book, a paper, or even left behind notes explaining why QWERTY looks the way it does. This wasn\u2019t an academic project, or a side interest. They were running a business. Sharing wasn\u2019t necessary and could be corporate suicide. Either way, sharing would also distract from the hard, multi-year task of designing a typewriter. Today, we can only piece the story from a scant few letters, patent applications, and models \u2013 plus a lot of informed speculation to fill in the blanks. 3 Some facts are certain. Early typewriter prototypes, the ones still looking like a piano, started in the most obvious, alphabetical order (or, at rare times, reversed alphabetical). Sholes had problems with some typebars bumping into one another while typing, and he started rearranging the letters to alleviate the issues. Remington made the last few changes after Sholes and Densmore gave them the rights to produce the machine. There\u2019s also the evidence of a tiny 1878 prototype typewriter used to test different typebar suspension ideas. That typewriter only has two rows of six keys each. The top one goes S O H L W I , and the bottom one R D T P E Y . These don\u2019t seem like particularly exciting keys, except if you realize they can write a pertinent phrase: \u201cSHOLES TYPEWRITER.\u201d But this was a tiny throwaway machine. As for the real typewriter, we\u2019ve discovered enough models, patents, and illustrations to tell us the last four years of QWERTY evolution looked something like these layouts: Historians don\u2019t know if changes proceeded in that exact order \u2013\u00a0or whether some of them were transcription mistakes. But there\u2019s enough smoke to know for sure there must have been fire: QWERTY did evolve between 1872 and 1876, and it\u2019s likely its emergence started years before. Even if we don\u2019t quite understand it yet, it no longer feels that the layout was just an act of randomness \u2013 we can see a definite pr</p> <p>...

But that\u2019s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I\u2019m actually as proud of the things we haven\u2019t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p> <p>But wait, we have AI now. We don\u2019t have to say no to 1,000 things. We can say yes to all the things \u2014 generate them all, simultaneously!</p> <p>Do you really have to \u201cpick carefully\u201d when AI can materialize everything you previously would\u2019ve been too constrained to do?</p> <p>Generative technology paired with being \u201cdata-driven\u201d means it\u2019s easy to build every idea, ship it, measure it, and see what sticks.</p> <p>Humans, money, time \u2014 these all used to be constraints which required budgets, trade-offs, and decision making.</p> <p>Organizations had an incentive to say \u201cno\u201d when development was constrained \u2014 \u201cWe can only do so much, so let\u2019s make sure we do the most impactful things.\u201d</p> <p>But maybe the scarcity of organizational resources was the wrong focus all along?</p> <p>It\u2019s never been a good idea to ship everything you think of. Every addition accretes complexity and comes with a cognitive cost.</p> <p>Maybe we need to reframe the concept of scarcity from us, the makers of software, to them, the users of software. Their resources are what matter most:</p> <ul> <li>Attention (too many features and they can\u2019t all be used, or even tried)</li> <li>Stability (too much frequent change is an impediment to learning a product)</li> <li>Clarity (too many options creates confusion and paralysis)</li> <li>Coherence (too many plots and subplots cannot tell a unified story)</li> </ul> <p>So maybe the way you argue for saying \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t because it helps you as a business, but because it helps your customers. It helps them make sense of what you\u2019ve made.</p> <p>And yet: arguing for customer clarity has always been harder than arguing for internal efficiency or some bottom line.</p> <p>In an age of abundance, restraint becomes the only scarce thing left, which means saying \u201cno\u201d is more valuable than ever.</p> <p>I\u2019m as proud of the things I haven\u2019t generated as the things I have.</p> <pre><code>&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n  Reply via:\n\n\n  &lt;a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/saying-no/\"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;\n  \u00b7 &lt;a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; \u00b7\n\n  &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:40:59</p>"},{"location":"blog.jim-nielsen.com/The%20Browser%E2%80%99s%20Little%20White%20Lies_20260201/","title":"The Browser\u2019s Little White Lies","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: blog.jim-nielsen.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:00:00 GMT \u94fe\u63a5: https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/browsers-white-lies/</p> <p>So I\u2019m making a thing and I want it to be styled different if the link\u2019s been visited.</p> <p>Rather than build something myself in JavaScript, I figure I\u2019ll just hook into the browser\u2019s mechanism for tracking if a link\u2019s been visited (a sensible approach, if I do say so myself). </p> <p>Why write JavaScript when a little CSS will do?

Per this theory, technologies can take advantage of learning curves, and thus will continue to get cheaper as they\u2019re deployed in larger and larger volumes; commodities, on the other hand, don\u2019t have learning curves, and thus can\u2019t be expected to get cheaper over time.</p><p>Here, for instance, is a report from the Rocky Mountain Institute advancing this theory:</p><p>There are two main perspectives on the energy transition: the old incumbent view of business-as-usual; and the new insurgent view of exponential change. At heart this is the longstanding battle of commodities versus technologies. Design and technologies beat commodities because they enjoy learning curves and are limitless. So costs fall over time, and growth is exponential. New energy comes from manufactured, modular, scalable, clean technologies; old energy is from centralized, heavy, dirty commodities.</p><p>This theory obviously favors increasing the rollout of renewable energy; the more renewables we build, the cheaper our energy will get, whereas if we stick with fossil fuels we can\u2019t expect that to happen.</p><p>Folks referencing this theory seem to disagree as to the exact mechanisms that are driving the difference between price trends in technologies and commodities. The same Rocky Mountain Institute report suggests it\u2019s because commodities have depletion dynamics and because cartels like OPEC can control the price:</p><p>Individual fossil fuel technologies of course do have learning curves; but because of depletion and cartels, fossil fuel prices have not shown structural decline over time.</p><p>Someone else suggested to me that what this distinction is really getting at is elasticity of supply \u2014 that it\u2019s much more straightforward to scale up the production of technologies than it is for commodities.</p><p>This 2011 paper from McNerney et al. on the historical price of coal-fired electricity suggests the difference is more about commodities being easily tradable:</p><p>Coal prices have fluctuated and shown no overall trend up or down; they became the most important determinant of fuel costs when average thermal efficiencies ceased improving in the U.S. during the 1960s. This fluctuation and lack of trend are consistent with the fact that coal is a traded commodity, and therefore, it should not be possible to make easy arbitrage profits by trading it. According to standard results in the theory of finance, this implies that it should follow a random walk. In contrast, plant construction costs, the most important determinant of capital costs, followed a decreasing trajectory until 1970, consistent with what one expects from a technology.</p><p>(I don\u2019t think this makes a ton of sense \u2014 as we\u2019ll see, something being tradable doesn\u2019t preclude it from getting cheaper over time \u2014 but I wanted to flag it as a mechanism folks use to explain the difference between technologies and commodities.)</p><p>Regardless of the mechanisms, I think the \u201ctechnologies vs. commodities\u201d theory is, in practice, actually bundling a few different questions together:</p><ul><li><p>To what extent can technologies and commodities be expected to decline in price over time?</p></li><li><p>Relatedly,  to what extent are technologies and commodities subject to different dynamics that will affect their price?</p></li><li><p>And finally, do commodities exhibit learning curves \u2014 that is, does their price decline as a function of cumulative production volume?</p></li></ul><p>Let\u2019s look at each one of these questions and try to answer them.</p>Do commodities get cheaper over time?<p>I think the idea that technologies (and more generally, manufactured goods) tend to exhibit declining prices over time is pretty clearly true. When Nagy et al. 2013 used the performance curve database to analyze cost trends for 62 different technologies, they found that Moore\u2019s Law (prices decreasing exponentially with time) was nearly as good as Wright\u2019s Law (prices decreasing exponentially with production volume) at predicting future prices. And if we create our own version of the famous AEI chart, and look at the cost trends of different categories of manufactured goods in the Consumer Price Index, we find that they almost all get cheaper in inflation-adjusted terms over time.</p><p>But as we noted last week, it\u2019s also common for commodities to get cheaper over time. 24 of 25 different agricultural commodities we looked at got cheaper over their time series, and 60 of 93 different mineral commodities were. Even fossil fuels have historically exhibited long periods where they got cheaper over time \u2014 oil got cheaper for the hundred-year period from the 1860s to the 1960s.</p><p>The graph that the Rocky Mountain Institute uses to demonstrate that commodities don\u2019t get cheaper in fact shows the price of coal-generated electricity falling by roughly a factor of 10 over a period of 70 years. This is by way of the \u201ctechnology\u201d of larger and more efficient coal plants, but it obviously deflates the technologies vs. commodities argument if in practice fossil fuel power can get cheaper over time by way of technological improvements, even if the fuel inputs themselves don\u2019t.</p><p>However, historically manufactured goods do seem more likely to get cheaper over time. Below are graphs showing the average annual real price change for 124 different commodities, and for 67 different categories of manufactured goods in the Consumer Price Index, over 20 year windows of time. (So iron ore, which has price data from 1900 to 1921, is broken into price windows from 1900 to 1919, 1920 to 1939, etc. and an average rate of real price change is calculated for each window.) We can see that while both commodities and manufactured goods have a tendency to get cheaper over time (seen as a left skew on the graph), the tendency is greater for manufactured goods.</p><p>(Note that this isn\u2019t a 1 to 1 comparison. Most manufactured good inflation data is post-1980, while the commodity price data in general stretches back much farther.)</p><p>The difference is even more stark if we just look at the 20-year period from 2000 to 2020. Manufactured goods still have a tendency to get cheaper, but commodities no longer do.</p><p>So contra the \u201ctechnologies vs. commodities\u201d theory, both technologies and commodities can get cheaper over time, but technologies seem to have more consistent price declines, particularly recently.</p>Do commodities and technologies have different price dynamics?<p>I think it\u2019s true that there are, broadly, somewhat different dynamics at work when it comes to the prices of technologies vs. commodities. Commodities (as I noted last week, and as the Rocky Mountain Institute report argues) can be subject to depletion dynamics: getting used up in a particular location. And because they\u2019re often found in specific locations, it\u2019s perhaps easier to control the supply of commodities and use that control to manipulate the price. OPEC was famously able to effectively control the price of oil for many years, and De Beers was able to control almost the entire world\u2019s supply of diamonds for over a century to keep prices artificially high.</p><p>But I think there\u2019s also a significant amount of overlap in the price and production dynamics of technologies and commodities. Commodities mined from the earth are still a product of technology, of some particular process that gets used to extract, refine, and transport them. Like with manufacturing processes, this production process can be improved and made more efficient over time. The technology used to drill oil and natural gas wells has improved enormously over time thanks to the development of PDC drill bits and hydraulic fracking. These and other technical improvements have allowed oil producers to get more and more oil from fewer and fewer drilling rigs.</p><p>These productivity improvements haven\u2019t cashed out as drops in the price of oil, but for other commodities process improvements have resulted in price declines. Most widely-used metal commodities \u2014 steel, aluminum, titanium \u2014 saw dramatic price declines following technological process improvements. (The introduction of the Bessemer process, the Hall-Herroult process, and the Kroll process respectively.)</p><p>Conversely, the depletion dynamics and diseconomies of scale that commodities can be subjected to can also be at work with technologies. Wind power may be a \u201ctechnology\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s produced via repetitively manufactured wind turbines which need no consumable fuel, but a wind turbine needs to be installed somewhere where the wind is blowing, and there\u2019s only so many places where the wind blows enough for wind power to be practical. Models of available wind resources in the US, for instance, show increasing cost of wind-generated electricity as deployment rises because the best, windiest sites get occupied first, and because wake effects from a wind farm can reduce the energy generated from adjacent wind farms. Actual deployment of wind turbines appears to be more complex than simply \u201cthe windiest sites get occupied first\u201d, but reduced energy generation from wake effects is already an issue, and is projected to become more serious:</p><p>\u201cWe have seen wake effects for years, and knew they happen,\u201d says Ouro. \u201cThe problem is that in order to achieve net zero, we need to deploy a given amount of offshore wind capacity. So for 2030, we need to have three times more capacity than we have now, which means that in less than five years, we need to deploy thousands more turbines,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201c[Some of] these turbines are going to be operating very close to those that are already operating, so things are getting more and more crowded. So these wake effects are now starting to have more impact,\u201d he says.</p><p>Another important diseconomy of scale for wind and solar specifically is that as they get more widely deployed, they often become less popular. We see this dynamic with data centers, which used to be strongly favored by local communities (since they paid tax dollars but didn\u2019t place much additional burden on local services) but now increasingly face opposition. And we\u2019re seeing it with wind and solar, which are getting increasingly opposed by local residents. A 2023 report from Columbia notes that \u201clocal opposition to renewable energy facilities is widespread and growing, and represents a potentially significant impediment to achievement of climate goals.\u201d A blog post from think tank R Street on wind energy permitting restrictions similarly notes that:</p><p>\u2026when we compare new ordinances to wind power generation in the United States, we see a matching trend, indicating that wind ordinances are likely a response to the increasing likelihood of living near permitted wind power. This would be consistent with findings that counties with or near wind power are also most likely to adopt restrictions on the development of wind power.</p><p>It\u2019s possible to overcome or offset some of these dynamics technologically. Lower wind speeds, for instance, can be dealt with by using larger, taller wind turbines (up to the point where such turbines become infeasible to build on land due to transportation difficulties). Solar PV labor costs can be overcome by better automation for panel installation. But of course, it\u2019s also possible to offset depletion dynamics technologically for commodities as well. Fracking is an obvious example, a technological development that made it possible to extract oil and natural gas from locations where it was previously infeasible or impractical to do so. Thanks to fracking, proven reserves of oil and natural gas in the US have actually increased since the year 2000.</p><p>Technologies can also be controlled by cartels, though my impression is that technology cartels are generally less successful than ones which try to control natural resources. The Phoebus light bulb cartel, which coordinated to artificially limit the lifespan of incandescent bulbs, only lasted for 14 years.</p><p>So in aggregate, there are probably somewhat different dynamics between commodities and technologies, but the boundaries between these categories are fairly fuzzy, and have a great deal of overlap. Commodity prices can decline over time thanks to technology improvements and economies of scale, and technologies can be affected by depletion dynamics and other diseconomies.</p>Do commodities have learning curves?<p>Determining if commodities have learning curves \u2014 that is, if they fall in price as a function of cumulative production volume \u2014 turns out to be a complicated question. If you just graph price vs. production volume data for various commodities, very few seem like they\u2019re following any sort of learning curve, showing nice straight or mostly-straight lines going down and to the right on a log-log plot. The USGS mineral commodity datasets, include worldwide production volume for various mineral commodities going back to 1900. Some of these look like they\u2019re following a learning curve, but most don\u2019t.</p><p>Similarly, USDA crop datasets include annual quantities harvested, which we can use to construct a learning curve. These look a little more like learning curves (they\u2019re generally headed down and to the right), but they\u2019re certainly not nice straight lines.</p><p>However, a major problem with these charts is that we\u2019re not actually graphing price against cumulative production volume. Instead, we\u2019re graphing price against production volume starting at some particular point in time. USGS mineral commodity data goes back to 1900, but most of those commodities were being produced long before 1900. Some minerals, like gypsum, copper, iron, and lime, have been mined for thousands of years.</p><p>Agricultural commodities have the same problem \u2014 crops were being harvested in the US long before the USDA datasets began. The learning curves above are thus missing a large amount of production that occurred prior to the beginning of the dataset.</p><p>If some amount of early production is missing from your learning curve dataset, this will distort the linear relationship between price and cumulative production on a log-log chart. Say you\u2019ve produced 1000 units of something total. If you\u2019re following a normal learning curve, you shouldn\u2019t expect costs to fall very much over the next 20 units: going from 1000 to 1020 is only a small fraction of a doubling, and learning curves will (theoretically) have a constant percentage decrease in cost for every doubling of cumulative production volume. Thus a very small decline in price is expected. But what if production data is missing, and you think you\u2019ve only produced 10 units instead of 1000. Now the next 20 units is a much larger fraction of production: you think you\u2019re going from 10 to 30, more than tripling cumulative production. Now a very small decline in price looks like a very flat learning curve.</p><p>The graphs below show several learning curves. The first is the \u201ctrue\u201d learning curve with all the production data intact. The other graphs have various amounts of early production data missing, causing the graph to incorrectly start at an earlier point. The more production is omitted, the more the learning curve flattens out and deviates from the true curve. And it doesn\u2019t take much omitted data to really distort the curves, so even the fact that most commodity use is fairly recent doesn\u2019t rescue us from this problem.</p><p>(Thanks to Matt Clancy for pointing this out.)</p><p>Because many commodities have been mined or harvested for centuries or millennia, it\u2019s hard to get an accurate sense of what cumulative production volume truly is. This makes commodities different from technologies or manufactured goods, where it\u2019s much easier to determine both when production started and what cumulative production is. Without good estimates of actual cumulative production volume, it\u2019s hard to tell whether commodities follow learning curves or not.</p><p>Interestingly, for a few commodities where we can be confident we\u2019re not missing much (if any) production volume, we often get something much more learning curve-like. Titanium metal, which basically didn\u2019t exist prior to the 20th century, follows a nice learning curve. Aluminum was only produced in tiny amounts prior to the invention of the Hall-Herroult process, and also follows a nice learning curve.</p><p>This isn\u2019t universally true. The USGS helium dataset probably covers almost all cumulative production (since helium wasn\u2019t isolated until 1895), but its price history doesn\u2019t appear especially learning curve-like, possibly due to government price controls or because it\u2019s almost entirely a byproduct of natural gas extraction. But it nevertheless seems notable.</p>Conclusion<p>Overall I think the \u201ctechnologies vs. commodities\u201d theory gets at a real, meaningful distinction. Manufactured goods do seem more likely to decline in price over time than extracted commodities, and are probably broadly subject to somewhat different price dynamics. It\u2019s also pretty unclear if commodities generally follow learning curves the way that manufactured goods do.</p><p>But this distinction is blurry, and in practice there\u2019s a lot of overlap between the two categories. Both commodities and technologies can have falling prices thanks to efficiency-enhancing production improvements, and both can be subject to depletion effects or other diseconomies of scale. And at the limit, the price of some technology should approach the price of its raw material inputs, making it in effect a bundle of commodities. For energy technologies (the only place I\u2019ve seen the \u201ctechnology vs. commodity\u201d distinction get made), there are also plenty of cases where the distinction breaks down. Hydropower isn\u2019t commodity-based (in the sense that it doesn\u2019t burn any fuel), but it also isn\u2019t the product of modular, repetitively manufactured goods like wind and solar are. And it\u2019s subject to severe depletion dynamics, since there\u2019s only so many places you can build a hydroelectric dam.</p><p>(I also find the \u201ctechnologies vs. commodities\u201d concept sort of philosophically irritating, as every aspect of civilization, from manufactured goods to commodities like steel, oil, and corn, is a product of technology.)</p><p>So while I don\u2019t think the distinction between technologies and commodities is meaningless, I also don\u2019t think it does a particularly good job of carving reality at the joints. I think folks would be better served talking about the specific dynamics at work, and the specific problems that need to be solved, rather than thinking in terms of what, in practice, is a pretty fuzzy abstraction.</p><p>Thanks to Matt Clancy and Austin Vernon for reading a draft of this.

This brought two 90s computer brands together, but the tie-up didn\u2019t go all that well. Let\u2019s dig in and see what Gateway was thinking, and why it didn\u2019t work. Because, let\u2019s face it, who wouldn\u2019t have wanted a never obsolete PC in a cow-spotted box? Gateway merger rumors In 2004, Gateway paid $266 million for rival Emachines, hoping its management could find Gateway\u2019s former magic. Gateway was the subject of merger rumors throughout the 90s. It seemed like the industry\u2019s most eligible bachelor. Dell wanted to merge with them to eliminate its biggest and most successful direct-order competitor. Compaq wanted to merge with Gateway in order to better compete with Dell\u2019s direct-order model. I don\u2019t know how much of it was analyst talk or actual talk, but I heard rumors of an IBM tie-up early in the decade, for the same reason, to shore up IBM\u2019s flailing PC business and make it easier to compete with Dell. None of those mergers came to pass. Instead, Gateway did the acquiring. Even though they did it in a somewhat unconventional way. Reverse merger with Emachines Gateway bought Emachines in 2004 \u2013yes, the PCs of never obsolete infamy \u2013and put its management in charge, hoping the combination could cut costs and improve profitability. It wasn\u2019t Emachines who bought Gateway Computers. Gateway only made it look that way, and it was partly by design. Gateway wanted Emachines\u2019 management. But the combined company still struggled to compete against Acer, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. The experiment proved to be short lived. Gateway wanted Emachines for a simple reason. Emachines was profitable, Gateway wasn\u2019t. Emachines computers were cheaper than Gateways, and yet, they\u2019d found a way to be profitable. So Gateway paid $266 million in cash and stock to get Emachines\u2019 management. It\u2019s not hard to see why Emachines\u2019 management couldn\u2019t figure out how to turn around Gateway, however. Emachines sold a very simple lineup of machines, designed to hit specific price points. Gateway sold a broader lineup at retail, and they sold essentially custom PCs via direct order. Offering a limited menu is easier than offering a limitless one. It\u2019s easier to be profitable and it\u2019s easier to deliver consistent results. The experiment didn\u2019t work. Just over three and a half years later, on August 27, 2007, Acer bought Gateway for $710 million. What might have worked for Gateway and Emachines post merger Gateway\u2019s magic in the 90s was that they had Apple-like loyalty. I found it downright weird. But like Apple, Gateway found a way to sell an experience, and they found a sizeable audience that found that experience pleasant. It worked rather well, until enough competitors dragged Gateway into a price war. Gateway cut the experience as part of the cost-cutting, but the experience was what everyone wanted. One of the things Steve Jobs did to turn Apple around was to cut the number of products it offered. The selection of models was too confusing and it also made things more expensive to build. If Gateway had taken its cue from Emachines and reduced its product line to a smaller number of models and reinstated the old Gateway customer service and experience, that would have stood a better chance of working rather than trying to go head to head with Dell with a management staff that wasn\u2019t used to that model. Gateway could have even tried reviving its Gateway Country retail stores to provide something even closer to the Apple experience.

It was the first 8086-based CPU with separate, non-multiplexed address and data buses and also the first with memory management and wide protection abilities. The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors and was nearly 100% backward compatible with the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors. The Intel 286 in the IBM PC/AT The Intel 286 powered the IBM PC/AT and later compatibles. Major PC manufacturers were still selling 286-based PCs as late as March 1992. IBM decided in 1982 to use the 80286 in the IBM PC/AT , introduced in August 1984, skipping the Intel 186 . PC/AT compatible computers using the 80286 remained on the market until the early 1990s. By the end of 1988, Intel estimates there were around 15 million 286-based PCs in use worldwide. It took until 1987 to sell 5 million units, so it\u2019s not unreasonable to think by the time the big name brands stopped selling the 286 in early 1992, it may have reached a user base over 30 million. Intel\u2019s first 80286 chips ran at a maximum clockrate of 5, 6 or 8 MHz. Intel later released 10 and 12 MHz versions. AMD and Harris later produced 16 MHz, 20 MHz and 25 MHz parts, respectively. The CPU of the late 80s The 80286 wasn\u2019t supposed to dominate the late 80s. The Motorola 68000 family had a lot of hype in 1984 and 1985, and it looked like the Apple Macintosh , Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga had a bright future. Then in 1986, Intel released the 386, which was new and shiny and glamorous and 32 bit. But the 286 just sold and sold. The reason makes sense. In the mid 1980s, the 286 gave a reasonably high level of performance while being much less expensive than a 386. A 286 clock for clock was about twice as fast as an 8088-based machine. But a 386DX was not clock for clock twice as fast as a 286. So it was easier to justify paying extra to get a 286 over an XT than paying extra to get a 386 over a 286. It seemed like a better value. Although it seems hard to believe, the 386SX was in some cases a touch slower than a 286 at the same clock speed. That\u2019s because of the extra overhead of being 32 bits internally but only having a 16-bit data bus. The advantage of the 386SX was the ability to run 32-bit software and reach higher clock speeds than the 286 ever did. If you wanted to run Windows, the 386SX made sense. But a 286 made a better DOS machine. But until Windows really caught on, the 286 lived in something of a sweet spot performance wise. The July 23, 1990 issue of Computerworld stated the 286 had 35% of the computer market. The 386DX was close behind at 31%, 386SX at 11%, the 8088/8086 at 9%, and the 486 at less than 1 percent. The Motorola CPUs had 14% combined. Living in the 386\u2019s shadow\u2026 and outselling it We tend to assume the 286 went away quickly because of the 386, but the 286 had a long life on the market. As late as March 1992, Gateway 2000 was selling a 16 MHz 286 for $1345 vs a comparable (same specs all around) 16 MHz 386SX with Windows for $1445. A 25 MHz 386DX cost $1895. I remember Windows 3.0 killing interest in the 286 but after researching it, I think it was a false memory. It\u2019s more like it was Windows 3.1 that killed interest in the 286.

While not officially the end of Radio Shack, the Radio Shack that still exists today is a shadow of its pre-2015 self. At one time, Radio Shack was a retail giant, with about as many stores as McDonald\u2019s, with a high percentage of them in small towns. A small town was about as likely to have a Radio Shack as a McDonald\u2019s, and might not have both. We saw it coming Post-bankruptcy, Radio Shack emerged under new ownership circa 2016 and operated storefronts in partnership with Sprint. That only lasted about two years. There wasn\u2019t much surprise when Radio Shack filed chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2015. Radio Shack had been declining since the 1990s. At its peak, Radio Shack had about 6,500 stores. By 2014, it was 2/3 that size, at closer to 4,300, but it was still too many stores for its business model at that time. Too many stores too close to each other Particularly in metropolitan areas, Radio Shack had too many stores too close to each other. Where I live, there were two Radio Shack locations about two and a half miles from each other in 2014. One was in a suburban strip mall in between a Sears Hardware store and a long defunct dollar store. The other was in a closed-air shopping mall near the entrance, between a USPS retail store and a Sears. In the 1980s and 1990s, both stores had enough traffic to justify their continued existence. The strip mall location moved at one point in the 1990s as the population around it shifted. Its previous location had been even closer to the mall. But as the 21st century entered its second decade, there were fewer and fewer reasons to go to Radio Shack. Having two stores within a five-minute drive of each other no longer made sense when each store only had 1-2 customers at any given time. It basically doubled the corporate parent company\u2019s overhead to serve the area, since they had to pay rent two places, keep enough inventory to fill two stores, and keep 1-2 employees in each store at all times. As time wore on, both stores suffered as corporate struggled to keep inventory stocked. I remember going to one store, only to find out they didn\u2019t have what I needed in stock, so I had to drive to the other one to get it. It was always anyone\u2019s guess which store was more likely to have what I needed. This was before the days when you could just visit a web site and check inventory online to see which location had what you needed in stock. Employee stories of this time painted a sad picture. Radio Shack couldn\u2019t close its underperforming stores The problem was Radio Shack had too many stores, but they couldn\u2019t close them. Rumor was they didn\u2019t have the money to close the stores, but there was another problem. A $250 million loan Radio Shack took from Salus Capital in 2013 limited Radio Shack to closing 200 stores a year without Salus\u2019 approval. In 2014, Radio Shack asked to close 1,000 stores, but Salus denied the request. Why Salus didn\u2019t protect its interests by letting Radio Shack\u2019s management do what it needed to do to remain solvent and pay the loan, I\u2019m not sure. Meanwhile, Radio Shack couldn\u2019t shore up its online presence to better compete with Amazon and Ebay. While other retail stores had started making it possible to check inventory online and order online for in-store pickup to be more convenient, Radio Shack didn\u2019t have the money to modernize. The dilemma of what to sell Radio Shack had been selling cellular phones since the 1980s. Smartphones increasingly could replace the majority of what Radio Shack stores sold for decades. So it made sense for Radio Shack to shift and sell more phones and fewer other consumer electronics. The problem was, as phones became an increasing percentage of what Radio Shack sold, competition heightened and profit margins shrunk. Carriers started subsidizing phones and opening their own stores to cut out the middleman. Besides Radio Shack, guess who else operated a retail store in the closed-air mall near me and a second location in a strip mall near me? Every major phone carrier, that\u2019s who. Well, not every major phone carrier operated two stores near me. Some operated three. And the reduced foot traffic made it hard to sell electronic toys like the Armatron and the siren-equipped fire chief\u2019s helmet to make up the difference. In theory, Radio Shack could have shifted again, turning itself into a miniature Best Buy, selling TVs, set top boxes like Rokus , audio gadgets, and game consoles, along with all the cables and adapters you\u2019d need. They could have offered a limited selection of largely private label electronics and competed on price, taking advantage of having much lower overhead because its stores were 1/10 the size. But they didn\u2019t have the money to do it. The $43 million in cash on hand at the time of bankruptcy wasn\u2019t enough capital to make that change. Bankruptcy wasn\u2019t quite the end of the line for Radio Shack In May 2015, General Wireless, a subsidiary of Standard General, purchased the Radio Shack brand name and related intellectual property for $26.2 million and partnered with Sprint to operate the stores. The very last time I visited Radio Shack in person was in January 2017, when it was under General Wireless ownership. Most of the other traffic while I was in the store was related to a Pokemon Go promotion they were running. One of the employees told me they expected the store would close soon. Sprint was struggling too, and the two companies didn\u2019t save each other. By March 2017, General Wireless filed for bankruptcy and started closing stores, shifting most of its business online. Modern-day Radio Shack Retail Ecommerce Ventures, a holding company owned by Alex Mehr and self-help influencer Tai Lopez, acquired Radio Shack in November 2020. In May 2023, Unicomer Group acquired control of the worldwide Radio Shack franchise. Unicomer is based in El Salvador and is one of the largest franchisors of Radio Shack, with stores in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The 2015 and 2017 bankruptcies resulted in the majority of Radio Shack stores in the United States closing. Most of what\u2019s left are franchises. Not long ago, I was picking up lunch, wearing my Radio Shack t-shirt sporting the iconic 1970s logo. The cashier gave me a puzzled look and asked me where the closest Radio Shack is. I said I didn\u2019t know. I looked it up when I got home because I was curious. Turns out it\u2019s 60 miles away, in Nashville, Illinois. But they have a much improved online presence now. If you want a snazzy Radio Shack mousepad for your retro computer and a Radio Shack USB flash drive for your Gotek in your retro computer , they\u2019ve got you covered. I use one of each with my Tandy 1000 EX. It just seems right.

The firm ceased operations in the United States in 2000. Its former rival, Acer, acquired the brand January 31, 2008 for $46 million. It was a once-unimaginable outcome for what had been the top-selling computer brand in the United States. But there\u2019s more to the story than that. The Packard Bell story is a brilliant piece of marketing. The computers were terrible, but the marketing was as good as it gets. And that\u2019s one of the reasons people remember it as one of the more prominent of the 90s computer brands , even if many who remember it don\u2019t remember it fondly. Packard Bell thrived on brand confusion This promotional coffee mug features the slogan \u201cAmerica grew up listening to us. It still does.\u201d The slogan encouraged people to think of an upstart as an old company. It dates to the late 1980s or early 1990s. What happened to Packard Bell? Bad quality caught up with it. In 1986, Packard Bell was the name of a defunct manufacturer of TVs and radios. Founded in 1926 or 1933 depending on how you count it, it survived until 1968 when it sold out to Teledyne. In the 1980s the brand still had some name recognition on its own. But look at the other names it resembled: Pacific Bell, the telephone company. Hewlett Packard , the computer company. Packard, the defunct maker of luxury cars. It sounded like an old-line company making quality products, which was what Beny Alagem counted on. He even put the slogan \u201cAmerica grew up listening to us. It still does,\u201d on its early marketing literature. People always confused them for something they weren\u2019t, and for a time, it helped. \u201cI don\u2019t know about other brands,\u201d one customer said to me when I was selling computers in 1994, pointing at Compaq and Dell. \u201cBut Packard Bell, that\u2019s an old company.\u201d Even my coworkers routinely thought Packard Bell was related to HP or to Packard, the car maker. Brand resurrections don\u2019t always work . But this one was one of the more successful ones in history, better than Atari but not quite as good as DeWalt . I think this one worked because there were multiple factors involved. Packard Bell\u2019s industrial design This Packard Bell D160 dates to the mid 1990s. The gray panel accents, created by Frog Design, were innovative for the time. Also note the updated logo. For about the first seven years, Packard Bell computers were generic-looking clones, but in 1994 they started changing things up. They had been one of the first companies to try to make desktop PCs smaller. And in 1994 when everyone was selling beige boxes, they brought in a firm called Frog Design to revamp their cases with different colors and even changing form factors including an unorthodox\u00a0L-shaped corner design . Was it great design? Ask an industrial designer. But I have to give them credit for trying. At the very least, their computers had a distinctive look. I will say my graphic design professor in college, Dr. Birgit Wassmuth, who was a huge admirer of Apple and SGI, called out Packard Bell by name for trying to make computers that weren\u2019t boring beige boxes. At the time, their designs were more bold than anything even Apple dared. From her perspective, here was a firm giving SGI-like designs at a rock-bottom price. But it takes more than industrial design to make great computers. What happened to Packard Bell? One of my classmates answered Dr. Wassmuth: \u201cPackard BELL? They make the lowest quality computers you can buy!\u201d Dr. Wassmuth diplomatically said she could only comment on the industrial design. She was a professor of design, not electrical engineering. It would have been a brilliant move, but instead, it was more like a last hurrah before their quality issues started catching up with them. Quality, or lack thereof Early on, Packard Bell PCs were OK. Their XT- and 286-class PCs lacked pizzazz, but by and large gave average reliability for a low price. That was largely because they were rebadged machines made by other OEMs, such as Samsung. By the 386SX era though, they were cheap and unreliable. And they stayed that way. The price meant they sold well. Very well, well enough to overtake Tandy as the best-selling brand of computer in North America. Typically they cost a couple hundred dollars less than a comparable PC from Hewlett Packard, Compaq (then a separate company), Dell , or IBM . When I worked at Best Buy in the mid 1990s, Packard Bell may have accounted for 50% of our computer sales, on its own. The problem was that if there was a corner to cut, they cut it. With exactly one exception. Since they put Intel CPUs in their PCs, they benefited from Intel\u2019s \u201cIntel Inside\u201d marketing campaign. Even some CIOs thought a Packard Bell computer with an Intel CPU in it was better than anything with an AMD or Cyrix chip in it. It wasn\u2019t true, but it proves how well those marketing campaigns worked together. Our local Compaq sales rep hated Intel for it, and that was why Compaq gave startup cash to Intel competitors like Nexgen . Compaq made better machines and didn\u2019t appreciate Intel telling everyone otherwise. Everything else inside a Packard Bell computer was lowest-bidder. Making matters worse, the power supplies tended to be weird form factors so you couldn\u2019t replace them with a $40 off-the-shelf unit when they failed, which was often. A replacement OEM unit cost $200 and would fail just as quickly as the old one did. Some of their motherboards were NLX form factor, which was expensive but replaceable. Others were weird form factors with no off the shelf replacement. Part of this was due to Packard Bell\u2019s unique industrial design. The computers looked good, but it limited what parts you could use to fix them. Poor quality doesn\u2019t have to be a death sentence. Gateway 2000 sold PCs that were below average in quality. People bought them anyway because Gateway had great customer service. Packard Bell combined below-average quality with lousy customer service. I personally took a lot of phone calls from Packard Bell buyers. It was easier to call the store for answers than the manufacturer. We got more repeat customers than Packard Bell did. Packard Bell\u2019s many sad returns I avoided Packard Bell when I sold computers because I wanted to sell solutions that would last. I saw how many of their computers came back. Officially, it was 1 in 6 sold. Industry average at the time was 1 in 12. Sometimes they came back with a good story. Early in the 386 era, computers came with keys. You could lock them to keep someone from turning them on without permission. Well, someone bought one, brought it home, set it up, and couldn\u2019t make it work. So they brought it back. \u201cI followed the instructions perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I turned the key and nothing happened!\u201d It\u2019s a computer, not a lawnmower. The key story remained a running joke for years. But more often than not, there was no humorous story involved. Just an unhappy customer who got buyer\u2019s remorse in less than four weeks. The hope was that customer service could talk them into an exchange rather than a refund. Stores\u2019 policies toward Packard Bell I worked at Best Buy for a couple of years. Our main competitor, Circuit City, also carried them. The two stores\u2019 attitudes toward Packard Bell was very different. Circuit City would advertise Packard Bell computers in the Sunday papers, but if you came into the store, they trashed talked Packard Bell, in hopes of getting you to buy an AST instead. And truthfully? They didn\u2019t have to lie. They could honestly say you were twice as likely to have a major problem with a Packard Bell computer than any other brand. Best Buy\u2019s policy was to position Packard Bell in a good-better-best lineup. Packard Bell was (allegedly) good. Acer was better. Compaq, Dell (or HP), and IBM were best. I pushed other brands because I wanted to sleep at night. If a customer came in with their mind set on Packard Bell, I\u2019d load one up on a cart for them. But if they wanted to talk about it, I directed them toward better brands. I never said anything bad about Packard Bell, but I gave nonverbal cues. I sold a lot of computers, but very few Packard Bells. Some of my coworkers flat out lied about Packard Bell quality. I\u2019m not sure if they knew they were lying or were just repeating what they\u2019d heard someone else say. But I wanted to sleep at night so I wouldn\u2019t do that. The favored line, when a customer said they heard Packard Bell computers were bad, was to say they may have had problems in the past, but they\u2019d come a long way, and then offer an extended warranty. Sorry, a \u201cperformance guarantee.\u201d What happened to Packard Bell was that eventually, the lies didn\u2019t work anymore. Once Compaq released its Presario line which narrowed the price difference, there was little reason to buy the lower quality machine. Few repeat buyers Not many people bought a second Packard Bell. They\u2019d get a $1,500 bundle\u2013which was cheap for the time\u2013and when the computer broke, they\u2019d buy a different brand and reuse the monitor and printer and whatever was left in the machine that still worked. Frequently the memory, CD-ROM drive, and sound card could be salvaged and re-used in a new PC. Packard Bell consistently received bad ratings from the PC magazines like PC World and PC Magazine and from consumer magazines like Consumer Reports . But the final blow was the 1995 revelation in that Packard Bell routinely sold \u201cnew\u201d PCs with recycled parts in them. That year, Packard Bell merged with NEC, the Japanese electronics maker. Some hoped that would mean better quality and lower prices due to the increased volume. The synergy didn\u2019t happen. By 2000, NEC pulled the name off the market. Packard Bell survived longer in Europe, though in name only as a division of Acer. Acer acquired Packard Bell on January 31, 2008 for a mere $46 million. Speculation at the time was that Acer bought Packard Bell to keep Lenovo from getting the brand nam</p> <p>...

But there was a problem. Only about 10 percent of Altair owners paid for Altair Basic. On February 3, 1976, Bill Gates decided to do something about it. He wrote a letter titled An Open Letter to Hobbyists in which, among other things, he said he made around $2 an hour writing Altair Basic. What Bill Gates\u2019 product did In this Feb. 3, 1976 letter, Gates claimed to make $2 an hour creating Altair Basic, due to piracy. Altair Basic was a useful product, to be sure. It was a programming language that was easy for a hobbyist to learn, even if they didn\u2019t have any formal training in computer science. It meant any hobbyist had a chance to write useful software for their new computer. But if they wanted to share their software with anyone, they needed a copy of the language in order to run it, because it didn\u2019t create standalone programs. To think in modern terms, it was like Python, where you generally need a copy of Python in order to run a program written in that language. It wasn\u2019t like C++, which produced standalone programs. The problem with MITS\u2019 business model MITS sold the computers and Altair Basic at a break-even price. The profit was in memory boards. If you bought memory boards from Altair at $264 each, they\u2019d sell you Altair Basic for $75. If you didn\u2019t buy Altair\u2019s memory boards, Basic cost $500. The problem was, Altair\u2019s 4K memory boards weren\u2019t completely reliable. Its design required the board to steal a cycle from the 8080 CPU to use as a pulse to refresh the memory. And if the CPU was busy and it missed a cycle, the contents of memory are lost. If you don\u2019t have reliable RAM, you don\u2019t have a reliable computer. Because of these problems, third parties started making and selling memory boards for the Altair. This meant some MITS customers were only buying the computer from Altair, then buying a third party memory board that worked. They didn\u2019t want to pay $500 to get what they saw as a necessary piece of software to use the computer. Some didn\u2019t even want to pay $75. A pre-release paper tape of Altair Basic disappeared in June 1975, about a month before MITS and Microsoft had even finalized their contract. A box containing 50 copies of the paper tape appeared at a subsequent Homebrew Computer Club meeting in Menlo Park, California. This was the club Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak famously attended where they gained the inspiration to build their Apple I computer. Bill Gates\u2019 Open Letter to Hobbyists MITS co-founder Ed Roberts saw the users who pirated Altair Basic as thieves, but also saw third party hardware companies as parasites. One of those companies changed its name to Parasitic Engineering in response to Ed Roberts\u2019 comments. It was against this backdrop of rampant piracy and name calling that Bill Gates wrote a letter titled \u201cAn Open Letter to Hobbyists,\u201d dated February 3, 1976. David Bunnell published the letter in Computer Notes, MITS\u2019 newsletter for its customers. Bunnell also sent copies of the letter to other publications. Five additional publications printed the letter. Gates took an everyman approach, arguing in the letter that pirates weren\u2019t stealing from a large corporation, they were stealing from a fellow hobbyist, one who had invested tens of thousands of dollars into creating the product, and ended up making less than $2 an hour on its sales. He ended with the plea that hobbyists who had copied the software come clean and pay for it, and said he would love to hire 10 programmers to create more software. Microsoft switched to fixed-price contracts rather than piecemeal royalties for its future deals with MITS and other computer makers. The cost ranged from $21,000 to $50,000, with most running around $35,000. Reaction to Gates\u2019 letter and assertions The letter resulted in a few tense responses. Hal Singer, editor of the Micro-8 newsletter, said Roberts initially promised the Altair 8800 would cost $395 but a working system cost $1,000, accusing him of false advertising and suggesting a class action lawsuit or Federal Trade Commission investigation might be in order. Singer also repeated rumors that Altair Basic was developed on a Harvard University computer funded by the US government, and therefore, customers should not pay for software already paid for by the taxpayer. Gates, Paul Allen, and Monte Davidoff had indeed used a PDP-10 at Harvard\u2019s Aiken Computer Center. The PDP-10 was funded by the Department of Defense through its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Harvard officials weren\u2019t pleased that Gates and a non-student, Paul Allen, used the PDP-10 to develop a commercial product. But since the computer belonged to the military, Harvard\u2019s wishes didn\u2019t apply. Professor Thomas Cheatham controlled the PDP-10, and he believed that students could use the machine for personal use. Harvard did eventually succeed in placing restrictions on the computer\u2019s use. Gates and Allen had to use a commercial time share computer in Boston to finalize the software. What happened to MITS and Microsoft Microsoft, of course, went on to become successful, first by selling Basic interpreters to computer manufacturers, then branching into other languages and, eventually, operating systems, application software, and even hardware. Not in that order. Bill Gates went on to become a millionaire, a billionaire, and the world\u2019s richest man, in that order. On December 3, 1976, Ed Roberts sold MITS to Pertec Computer Corporation for $6 million in stock. Roberts received $2 million. The remaining MITS shareholders split the remaining $4 million. Roberts moved to Georgia where he bought a farm and enrolled in medical school, graduating in 1986. He practiced medicine in the small town of Cochran, Georgia, for 24 years until his death in 2010.

You toss it 14 times and end up with 10 heads. Your friend thinks at least one of the next two tosses will end up tails, and is willing to offer you $10 in an even-money bet on it. Should you take him up? This is a fancy way of asking, Is the probability of two heads on the next two tosses greater than 50\u00a0%? Rajiv claims to look at this from a frequentist perspective, arriving at a 51\u00a0% probability, and then a Bayesian perspective, arriving at 48.5\u00a0%. Therein lies the puzzle: one says \u201ctake the bet!\u201d and the other says \u201cask for better odds!\u201d How can statistics betray us like that in our time of greatest need? Fortunately, it is based on flawed analysis. Laplace\u2019s law of succession The problem with that analysis is that a true frequentist is unable to answer the question we have asked. The question of the probability of the next two tosses doesn\u2019t even make sense from a frequentist perspective. This is why frequentists test hypotheses by performing contortionist tricks like asking, Assuming heads and tails are equally likely, what would be the likelihood of observing 10 heads in the next 14 tosses? and then comparing that likelihood to an arbitrary threshold. This is not a strawman position on frequentism \u2013 this is the very thing that plagued the father of frequentism, Ronald Fisher, for all his life. Frequentists can, of course, answer a trivial questions like What was the probability of heads in the past 14 tosses? and it is tempting to extrapolate the answer to that straight into the future, but again, that would not be a valid operation according to a frequentist . Frequentists cannot assign probabilities to future events, they can only compare probabilities of past events. Now, not all is lost. There\u2019s a neat trick that blends faux frequentism with Bayesian reasoning. If our prior probability is uniformly distributed, we can update it with Laplace\u2019s rule of succession , which tells us to imagine there have been two more trials, one of which was successful. Then the ratio corresponds to the Bayesian posterior. In this case, that means imagining there were 11 heads in 16 tosses. The new ratio is (\\frac{11}{16}) and the posterior probability of two heads would then be (\\left(\\frac{11}{16}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.47). This is much easier and gives almost the same result as the actual Bayesian calculation, and the computer approximation. 1 1 Why is this a slightly different number than the actual value of 48.6\u00a0%? Because we have converted the posterior distribution to a point estimation, and then squared the point estimation. Jensen\u2019s inequality tells us we will arrive at a lower number that way than if we first square the posterior distribution and then make a point estimation. This is a law of succession most forecasters are familiar with: add one success and one failure to get the Bayesian posterior of coin flips. It\u2019s called Laplace\u2019s law of succession. Agresti\u2013Coull confidence intervals Here, have a pair of frequentist goggles; I want to take away your ability to estimate probabilities of future events again. Even as frequentists, we can still perform a standard hypothesis test to figure out whether we should believe the coin is biased at all. For this we need a 95\u00a0% confidence interval around the bias. The quick way to whip one of those up is to first pretend there were four more trials: two successes and two failures. Then we compute the size of two standard errors the normal way: [\\hat{p} = \\frac{10+2}{14+4} \\approx 0.67] [2\\hat{se} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}\\left(1 - \\hat{p}\\right)}{14+4}} \\approx 0.22] This gives us a confidence interval of 45\u00a0%\u201389\u00a0% for the bias. Since that includes 50\u00a0%, our null hypotheses, we cannot reject the null hypothesis and have to contend with the fact that the coin might not be biased at all. This is probably a reason not to take the bet. See, Rajiv, frequentists are not so dumb after all! This procedure is called an Agresti\u2013Coull confidence interval, and it\u2019s an approximation that\u2019s very close to an actual confidence interval. The drawback is that this simple version only lets us create two-sided 95\u00a0% confidence intervals. The paper by Agresti and Coull contains the details to construct other confidence intervals, but it gets a little more arithmetically complicated. Poisson-based law of succession Imagine now someone tosses the coin once a week, and in the past year, it has landed on heads four times. What\u2019s the probability it lands on tails next week? We can use what we already know here. There have been 52 trials and 4 heads, so that\u2019s a posterior of 5\u29f854\u22480.093 for heads. The inverse of this is the probability that it does not land on heads in any given week: 90.7\u00a0%. What if we had misheard, and the coin was actually tossed every day? This makes the coin extremely biased. It has been tossed for 365 days and only landed heads four times! 2 2 A calendar year actually has 365.2425 days, but here we use \u201cyear\u201d to mean \u201cthe past 365 days\u201d. By the same approach, we have the posterior 5\u29f8367\u22480.014. On the other hand, during the next week, it will have more opportunities to come up heads as well. To get the weekly probability of no heads, we have to take the inverse of the posterior and raise it to the power of 7. We get 90.8\u00a0%. Oh but wait, I meant to say it is flipped every minute, not every day! Assuming there are 525600-something minutes per year, we get a weekly probability of heads of 90.9\u00a0%. The general trend starts to show: when we pick finer subdivisions of time, the probability goes up, because we get more certain about our estimation. The posterior is more and more getting shaped by the data rather than the uniform prior. We could compute the probability if the coin was flipped every second, every millisecond, etc. But we won\u2019t, because there\u2019s a limit this tends to: [\\left(1 + \\frac{t}{T}\\right)^{-(S + 1)}] Here, (t) is the future timespan we are interested in, (T) is the timespan in the past we have observed for, and (S) are the number of successes observed in that timespan. Unlike in the previous Laplace case, the units of the timespans do not matter here, because they cancel out. With our coin, taking weeks as the natural unit: [\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{52}\\right)^{-(4 + 1)} \\approx 0.909] This is the probability that a continuously flipped coin shows heads any time during next week, if it has done so four times in the past year. This is nearly the same probability as when we computed Laplace\u2019s law of succession using minutes as the time increment, and this will be the case more generally. If we pick a time increment that is small compared to the future period we\u2019re interested in, Laplace\u2019s law of succession will give an answer very close to this limit. The benefit of knowing how to compute the limit is that we can use more convenient units of time when doing so. For more examples of this continuous limit, see the LessWrong article that introduces it . Key points We don\u2019t really have to learn the continuous limit. If we\u2019re fine with arithmetic using big numbers, we can use the plain Laplace rule even for continuous processes, as long as we pick a subdivision of time that is small enough. What needs to be remembered is that with (s) successes in (n) trials, the posterior probability is [\\frac{s+1}{n+2}.] But also, if we want a 95\u00a0% confidence interval, we compute [\\hat{p} = \\frac{s+2}{n+4}] and [2\\hat{se} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n+4}}] and then the interval is [\\left(\\hat{p}-2\\hat{se}, \\hat{p}+2\\hat{se}\\right)] It is easy to get these two methods confused, because they both add virtual successes and failures.

Shoup did not study cancer, nuclear physics, or AI. No, Shoup studied parking. He spent his whole career documenting the fact that \u201cfree\u201d parking ultimately backfires, and it\u2019s better to charge for parking instead and use the revenues to make neighborhoods nicer: plant trees, spruce up the parks, keep the sidewalks clean.1</p><p>Shoup\u2019s ideas have been adopted all over the world, with heartening results. When you price parking appropriately, traffic goes down, fewer people get tickets, and you know there\u2019s going to be a space waiting for you when you arrive.</p><p>Many so-called \u201cthought leaders\u201d strive for such an impact and never come close. What made Shoup so effective? Three things, says his student M. Nolan Gray:</p><ol><li><p>He picked an unsexy topic where low-hanging fruit was just waiting to be picked.</p></li><li><p>He made his ideas palatable to all sorts of politics, explaining to conservatives, libertarians, progressives, and socialists how pay-for-parking regimes fit into each of their ideologies.2</p></li><li><p>He maintained strict message discipline. When asked about the Israel-Palestine protests on campus, he reportedly responded, \u201cI\u2019m just wondering where they all parked\u201d.</p></li></ol><p>So the next time you find a convenient parking spot, thank Shoup, and the next time you want to apply your wits to improving the world, be Shoup.</p>source<p>Jane Jacobs, the great urban theorist, once wrote that the health of a neighborhood depends on its \u201cpublic characters\u201d.3 For instance, two public characters in Jacobs\u2019 neighborhood are Mr. and Mrs. Jaffe, who own a convenience store. On one winter morning, Jacobs observes the Jaffes provide the following services to the neighborhood, all free of charge:</p><ul><li><p>supervised the small children crossing at the corner on the way to [school]</p></li><li><p>lent an umbrella to one customer and a dollar to another</p></li><li><p>took custody of a watch to give the repair man across the street when he opened later</p></li><li><p>gave out information on the range of rents in the neighborhood to an apartment seeker</p></li><li><p>listened to a tale of domestic difficulty and offered reassurance</p></li><li><p>told some rowdies they could not come in unless they behaved and then defined (and got) good behavior</p></li><li><p>provided an incidental forum for half a dozen conversations among customers who dropped in for oddments</p></li><li><p>set aside certain newly arrived papers and magazines for regular customers who would depend on getting them</p></li><li><p>advised a mother who came for a birthday present not to get the ship-model kit because another child going to the same birthday party was giving that</p></li></ul><p>Some people think they can\u2019t contribute to the world because they have no unique skills. How can you help if you don\u2019t know kung fu or brain surgery? But as Jacobs writes, \u201cA public character need have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function\u2014although he often does. He just needs to be present [...] his main qualification is that he is public, that he talks to lots of different people.\u201d Sometimes all we need is a warm body that is willing to be extra warm.</p><p>I once did a high school science fair experiment where I put Mentos in different carbonated beverages and measured the height of the resulting geysers. The scientific value of this project was, let\u2019s say, limited, but I did learn something interesting: despite how it looks to the naked eye, bubbles don\u2019t come from nowhere. They only form at nucleation sites\u2014little pits and scratches where molecules can gather until they reach critical mass.</p>the title page of my science fair report (photo cred: my dad)<p>The same thing is true of human relationships. People are constantly crashing against each other in the great sea of humanity, but only under special conditions do they form the molecular bonds of friendship. As far as I can tell, these social nucleation sites only appear in the presence of what I would call unreasonable attentiveness.</p><p>For instance, my freshman year hallmates were uncommonly close because our resident advisor was uncommonly intense. Most other groups shuffle halfheartedly through the orientation day scavenger hunt; Kevin instructed us to show up in gym shorts and running shoes, and barked at us back and forth across campus as we attempted to locate the engineering library and the art museum. When we narrowly missed first place, he hounded the deans until they let us share in the coveted grand prize, a trip to Six Flags.</p><p>We bonded after that, not just because we had all gotten our brains rattled at the same frequency on the Superman rollercoaster, but because we could all share a knowing look with each other like, \u201cThis guy, right?\u201d Kevin\u2019s unreasonable attentiveness made our hallway A Thing. He created a furrow in the fabric of social space-time where a gaggle of 18-year-olds could glom together.</p><p>Being in the presence of unreasonable attentiveness isn\u2019t always pleasant, but then, nucleation sites are technically imperfections. Bubbles don\u2019t form in a perfectly smooth glass, and human groups don\u2019t form in perfectly smooth experiences. Unreasonable attentiveness creates the slight unevenness that helps people realize they need something to hold onto\u2014namely, each other.</p><p>Peter Askew didn\u2019t intend to become an onion merchant. He just happened to be a compulsive buyer of domain names, and when he noticed that VidaliaOnions.com was up for sale, he snagged it. He then discovered that some people love Vidalia onions. Like, really love them:</p><p>During a phone order one season \u2013 2018 I believe \u2013 a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to \u2018take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad.\u2019</p><p>But these allium aficionados didn\u2019t have a good way to get in-season onions because Vidalias can only be grown in Georgia, and it\u2019s a pain for small farms to maintain a direct-to-consumer shipping business on the side. Enter Askew, who now makes a living by pleasing the Vidalia-heads:</p><p>Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: \u201cTHE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!\u201d</p><p>People have polarized views of business these days. Some people think we should feed grandma to the economy so it can grow bigger, while other people think we should gun down CEOs in the street. VidaliaOnions.com is, I think, a nice middle ground: you find a thing people want, you give it to them, you pocket some profit. So if you want an honest day\u2019s work, maybe figure out what else people want chopped up and put on their cruise ship salads.</p>I was going to make a joke about Vidalia onions being a subpar cruise food because they don\u2019t prevent scurvy but it turns out they actually contain a meaningful amount of vitamin C so wow maybe these things really are as great as they say (source)<p>I know a handful of people who have needed immigration lawyers, and they all say the same thing: there are no good immigration lawyers.</p><p>I think this is because the most prosocially-minded lawyers become public defenders or work at nonprofits representing cash-strapped clients, while the most capable and amoral lawyers go to white-shoe firms where they can make beaucoup bucks representing celebrity murderers and Halliburton. This leaves a doughnut hole for people who aren\u2019t indigent, but also aren\u2019t Intel. So if you want to help people, but you also don\u2019t want to make peanuts, you could do a lot of good by being an honest and competent immigration lawyer.</p><p>I think there are lots of jobs like that, roles that don\u2019t get good people because they aren\u2019t sacrificial enough to attract the do-gooders and they aren\u2019t lucrative enough to attract the overachievers. Home repair, movers, daycares, nursing homes, local news, city government\u2014these are places where honesty and talent can matter a lot, but supply is low.</p><p>So if your career offers you the choice of being a starving saint or a wealthy sinner, consider being a middle-class mensch instead. You may not be helping the absolute neediest people, and you may not be able to afford a yacht, but there are lots of folks out there who would really like some help getting their visas renewed, and they\u2019d be very happy to meet you.</p><p>Subscribe now</p><p>I have this game I like to play called Viral Statistics Bingo, where you find statistics that have gone viral on the internet and you try to trace them back to their original source.

That number is probably not exactly right, but then, no statistic is exactly right\u2014the point is that it puts us in the right ballpark, that you can check her work for yourself, and that it\u2019s a lot better than basing our numbers on a study done in mice.</p><p>The US does a bad job regulating clinical trials, and it means we don\u2019t invent as many life-saving medicines as we could.  is trying to change that, and she says that scientists and doctors often give her damning information that would be very helpful for her reform efforts. But her sources refuse to go on the record because it might put their careers in a bit of jeopardy. Not real jeopardy, mind you, like if you drive your minivan into the dean\u2019s office or if you pants the director of the NIH.

In between working, eating, and sleeping, you must also navigate the terrors of various bureaucracies that can do whatever they want to you with basically no consequences.</p><p>For example, if you have the audacity to go to a hospital in the US, you will receive mysterious bills for months afterwards (\u201cYou owe us $450 because you went #2 in an out-of-network commode\u201d). If you work at a university, you have to wait weeks for an Institutional Review Board to tell you whether it\u2019s okay to ask people how much they like Pop-Tarts.

What if we asked him to get the sticker instead, and only fined him if he didn\u2019t follow through? Because seriously, how are people supposed to know about this sticker system?

I got the impression that he didn\u2019t have anywhere else to be, but we didn\u2019t mind, because Wally was Good Audience.</p><p>When the jokes were good, he laughed loud and hard, and when the jokes were bad, he politely waited for more good jokes. Wally brought his friends, they brought their friends, and having more Good Audience made the acts better, too. (When comedians only perform for each other, no one laughs.) Eventually the gig got big, so big that it would sell out every week, and we\u2019d have to set aside a ticket for Wally or else he wouldn\u2019t get in.

Look at this!\u201d</p><p>Years ago, my friend Drew was visiting me when we noticed a whiff of natural gas in the hallway outside my apartment. I thought it was nothing\u2014my building wasn\u2019t the nicest, and it often smelled of many things\u2014but Drew, who is twice as affable and Midwestern as I am, insisted we call the gas company. A bored technician arrived and halfheartedly waved his gas-detecting wand around my neighbor\u2019s door, at which point his eyes got wide. He rushed to the basement, where he saw the gas meter spinning wildly, meaning that gas was pouring into my neighbor\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta get this door open,\u201d he said.</p><p>No one answered when we pounded on the door, so we summoned the fire department, who busted open a window and found my neighbor unconscious on the floor. His stove\u2019s burners was on, but not lit, turning his apartment into a gas chamber. They told us the guy probably would have died if someone didn\u2019t call, and the building might have caught on fire.</p><p>I was glad the guy survived, but I was ashamed that he had to be saved by a total stranger, while his own neighbor was ready to walk on by. I should have known him! I should have brought him Christmas cookies! We should have played checkers in the park on Saturdays! In the days afterward, I fantasized about knocking on his door or leaving him a note, like, \u201cHey! I notice you are elderly and alone, and I am young and nearby, maybe we should get a Tuesdays with Morrie thing going?\u201d</p><p>But I never did that. I was too intimidated. Besides, am I supposed to become bosom buddies with every schmuck who lives in my building? Who\u2019s got time for that?</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve lived among many schmucks in many different buildings, I realized that I didn\u2019t need to be this guy\u2019s best friend. I just needed to be his acquaintance. If I knew his name, if I had even spoken to him once in the hallway, then when I got a noseful of gas outside his door, I would have thought to myself, \u201cOh, Rob\u2019s apartment shouldn\u2019t smell like that.\u201d Rob \u2018n\u2019 me were never going to be Mitch and Morrie, but we could have easily been Guys Who Kind of Recognize Each Other and Would Be Willing to Report the Presence of Dangerous Chemicals on Each Other\u2019s Behalf.</p><p>A lot of well-intentioned people suffer from what we might call Superhero Syndrome: they want to save the world, but they want it to be saved by them in particular. They want to be the one who blows up the Death Star, not the one who washes the X-Wings.</p><p>This is a seductive fantasy because it disguises selfishness as sacrifice. It promises to excuse a lifetime of mediocrity with one great gesture, to pay off all your karmic debts in one fell swoop. The result is a world full of heroes-in-waiting who comfort themselves by thinking they would jump on a grenade if the situation ever presented itself, which fortunately it never does.</p><p>We do occasionally need someone to shoot torpedos into the exhaust port of a giant doomsday machine.

SpaceX will be oh so much better with access to all your tweets and xAI\u2019s models! That\u2019s the narrative Elon\u2019s selling. You can read it on the SpaceX website, which tells us that the merged everything company will be \u201cthe most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world\u2019s foremost real-time information and free speech platform\u201d. It\u2019s a floor wax that\u2019s also a dessert topping!  Hopefully back in the real world the good folks at SpaceX aren\u2019t about to replace their carefully-developed symbolic navigation algorithms with an LLM trained on X. Kaboom.</p><p>Theory Two (\u201cMusk is tightening his grip over the tech that shapes national security, social media, and Al\u201d, per WIRED) is that Elon wants to run the world, and what\u2019s better than a soup to nuts integration between owning your tweets and owning the satellites your data crosses? I don\u2019t doubt for a minute  that Musk wants to tighten his grip on all of that, but I don\u2019t immediately see how this move accomplishes that.</p><p>Theory Three (\u201cMusk\u2019s SpaceX-xAl deal is an ambitious bet that the future of Al compute is in space\u201d, per the Information) also seems dodgy. I hear all the chatter about build data centers in space, but a joint venture between the satellite company and the people building infrastructure for XAI might suffice. If you even believe at all that data centers in space are really going to be a big, profitable thing in the next decade. (Count me skeptical, though the economics of such things is not my area of expertise.)</p><p>Me, I think the merger is really a kind of bailout, to give a lot of cash to a company that is otherwise in distress. Fact is, xAI ain\u2019t doing all that great. It\u2019s burning money fast, with no obvious business model or market niche, and has little to show for it. They have also faced a lot of backlash for being reckless and irresponsible; hardly a good brand name. Grok (their main product) doesn\u2019t have the users that ChatGPT has, and it doesn\u2019t have the prestige that Google\u2019s Gemini seems to be racking up. It also doesn\u2019t have the clear corporate focus that Anthropic has. Nor does it have any obvious secret sauce. These numbers below from The Information are jawdropping. Would you want to give up valuable SpaceX shares for an also-ran?</p><p>For me anyway, the math ain\u2019t mathing. Trading SpaceX at sixty times 2025 revenue seems, um, optimistic, but at least they have a near-monopoly on both low-cost rackets and satellite internet infrastructure. In contrast, trading xAI at a thousand times revenue when they are in an increasingly crowded field where everyone is being forced into price wars seems nuts. If I owned SpaceX shares I would feel like Elon way overpaid for his own company. For not that much more they could have bought Anthropic, which has had far broader adoption and far less controversy attached to it. </p><p>Anyone remember Tesla\u2019s acquisition of Musk\u2019s SolarCity, and how that turned out?</p><p>Subscribe now</p><p>Ps Update to my Sunday essay on OpenClaw. Intensely pro-AI company Microsoft is now warning its own employees about security risks. Per an internal memo reviewed by The Information, the company advises employees that OpenClaw is \u201cnot a solved version of computer use\u201d (ie not ready for prime time) and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t suddenly make browser-driving agents reliable\u201c.

Theoretically (I will get to that) Moltbook \u201crestricts posting and interaction privileges to verified AI agents, primarily those running on the OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot) software, while human users are only permitted to observe.<sup>[1]</sup><sup>\u201d</sup></p><p>It truly is interesting, and truly is popular. Quoting from Wikipedia, </p><p>Taglined as \u201cthe front page of the agent internet,\u201d Moltbook gained viral popularity immediately after its release. While initial reports cited 157,000 users, by late January the population had exploded to over 770,000 active agents.<sup>[2]</sup> The platform has drawn significant attention due to the rapid, unprompted emergence of complex social behaviors among the bots, including the formation of distinct sub-communities, economic exchanges, and the invention of a parody religion known as \u201cCrustafarianism.\u201d<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup></p><p>As an experiment in what AI\u2019s working together might do it\u2019s fascinating. The Fortune story on Moltbook, for example, mentions \u201cOn Moltbook, bots can talk shop, posting about technical subjects like how to automate Android phones. Other conversations sound quaint, like one where a bot complains about its human, while some are bizarre, such as one from a bot that claims to have a sister.\u201d </p><p>But the whole thing remind me of Saturday Night Live\u2019s old bad idea jeans skit. And not just because I think that a bots claiming to have a sister is chatbot garbage. Nope, the problem is much deeper than that.</p><p>\u00a7</p><p>OpenClaw itself is basically a cascade of LLMs. In many ways to it is eerily similar to earlier and now largely forgotten system called AutoGPT, which I warned about in May 2023, in my US Senate testimony:</p><p>A month after GPT-4 was released, OpenAI released ChatGPT plug-ins, which quickly led others to develop something called AutoGPT. With direct access to the internet, the ability to write source code and increased powers of automation, this may well have drastic and difficult to predict security consequences.</p><p>Mercifully, AutoGPT died a quick death, before it caused too much chaos. Although, it was super popular in certain circles for a few weeks  it didn\u2019t work remotely reliably, and people lost patience quickly.  Per wiki, it had \u201c a tendency to get stuck in loops, hallucinate information, and incur high operational costs due to its reliance on paid APIs.<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[2]</sup><sup>[6]</sup><sup>\u201d. </sup>Sic transit gloria mundi. By the end of 2023 it was largely forgotten.</p><p>Unfortunately, OpenClaw is poised to have (slightly) more staying power, in part because more people found out about it more quickly. </p><p>\u00a7</p><p>Systems like OpenClaw and AutoGPT offer users the promise of insane power -- but at a price. At their best, they can basically do anything a human personal assistant or intern might do (booking itineraries, maintaining finances, writing reports, tracking and even completing tasks), etc.  Some of the enthusiasm is captured in this news report:</p><p></p><p>The journalist enthuses</p><p>For the past week or so, I\u2019ve been working with a digital assistant that knows my name, my preferences for my morning routine, how I like to use Notion and Todoist, but which also knows how to control Spotify and my Sonos speaker, my Philips Hue lights, as well as my Gmail. It runs on Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.5 model, but I chat with it using Telegram. I called the assistant Navi (inspired by the fairy companion of Ocarina of Time, not the besieged alien race in James Cameron\u2019s sci-fi film saga), and Navi can even receive audio messages from me and respond with other audio messages generated with the latest ElevenLabs text-to-speech model. Oh, and did I mention that Navi can improve itself with new features and that it\u2019s running on my own M4 Mac miniserver?</p><p>If this intro just gave you whiplash, imagine my reaction when I first started playing around with Clawdbot, the incredible open-source project by Peter Steinberger (a name that should be familiar to longtime MacStories readers) that\u2019s become verypopular in certain AI communities over the past few weeks. I kept seeing Clawdbot being mentioned by people I follow; eventually, I gave in to peer pressure, followed the instructions provided by the funny crustacean mascot on the app\u2019s website, installed Clawdbot on my new M4 Mac mini (which is not my main production machine), and connected it to Telegram.</p><p>To say that Clawdbot has fundamentally altered my perspective of what it means to have an intelligent, personal AI assistant in 2026 would be an understatement.</p><p>The catch is that agents like OpenClaw are built on a foundation of LLMs, and as we well know, LLMs hallucinate and make all kinds of hard to predict and sometimes hard to detect errors. AutoGPT had a tendency to report that it had completed tasks that it hadn\u2019t really, and we can expect OpenClaw to do the same. (I have already heard some reports of various stupid errors it makes).</p><p>But what I am most worried about is security and privacy. As the security researcher Nathan Hamiel put it to me in a text this morning, half-joking, moltbot, is \u201cbasically just AutoGPT with more access and worse consequences.\u201d (By more access what he means is that OpenClaw is being given access to user passwords, databases, etc, essentially everything on your system).</p><p>One of the big issues, which Hamiel and I wrote about here in August  (pre OpenClaw, but in the context of AI agents writing and debugging code) is prompt injection attacks, in which stray bit of texts can have nasty consequences. In essay called LLMs + Coding Agents = Security Nightmare, we talked about how LLMs, which mimic human text (and even human-written code) but understand what that they produce only superficially, can easily be tricked. We talked for instance about how an \u201cattacker could hide malicious prompts in white text on a white background, unnoticed by humans but noticed by the LLM\u201d, using the malicious prompts to seize control of the users machines.  </p><p>OpenClaw inherits all these weaknesses. In Hamiel\u2019s words (in an email this morning), \u201cthese systems are operating as \"you.\u201d \u2026 they operate above the security protections provided by the operating system and the browser. This means application isolation and same-origin policy don\\'t apply to them.\u201d Truly a recipe for disaster. Where Apple iPhone applications are carefully sandboxed and appropriately isolated to minimize harm, OpenClaw is basically a weaponized aerosol, in prime position to fuck shit up, if left unfettered. </p><p>\u00a7</p><p>That brings me to Moltbook, which is one of the wildest experiments in AI history. Moltbook, the social network that is allegedly restricted to AI agents, is an accident waiting to happen. It has already been attacked, as researcher Michael Riegler noted yesterday on LinkedIn:</p><p>Riegler and his collaborator Sushant Gautam have set up a real-time observatory to track all this as is unfolds. In their inital report, they find that substantial evidence that \u201cAI-to-AI manipulation techniques are both effective and scalable. These findings have implications beyond Moltbook, any AI system processing user-generated content may be vulnerable to similar attacks.\u201d</p><p>By email, Riegler sent me examples like these, already spotted in the wild: </p><p>\u00a7</p><p>Side note, it\u2019s also apparently not really just humans, which only grows the vectors of tampering:</p><p>As Rahul Sood put it on X (referring to Clawdbot, an earlier name for Moltbot)</p><p>\u00a7 </p><p>Right on cue, 404 Media has just reported one of the first major vulnerabilities:</p><p>\u00a7</p><p>I don\u2019t usually give readers specific advice about specific products. But in this case, the advice is clear and simple: if you care about the security of your device or the privacy of your data, don\u2019t use OpenClaw. Period.</p><p>(Bonus advice: if your friend has OpenClaw installed, don\u2019t use their machine. Any password you type there might be vulnerable, too. Don\u2019t catch a CTD \u2014 chatbot transmitted disease)</p><p>I will give the last words to Nathan Hamiel, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this needs to be said, it isn\u2019t rocket science. If you give something that\u2019s insecure complete and unfettered access to your system and sensitive data, you\u2019re going to get owned\u201d.</p><p>Wanna know what ideas are bad?

When ChatGPT launched, it was trading at 14; it\u2019s gone up by more than a factor of ten since then, rising, until recently like a rocket. </p><p>Aside from Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, a brilliant and impressive CEO with considerable foresight, nobody was more responsible for Nvidia\u2019s rise than Sam Altman, the relentless showman who runs OpenAI \u2014 and who repeatedly promised the moon. </p><p>My favorite representative quote from Altman, just over a year ago, came in January 2025, back when too many people had too much faith him, writing in his blog \u201cwe are now confident we know how to build AGI.\u201d It turns out this was authoritative bullshit. It sounded true and was said with confidence, but it was purely a bluff. Altman didn\u2019t actually know how to build AGI [artificial general intelligence] then, and probably still doesn\u2019t. Nvidia\u2019s rise was predicated on the wrong-headed idea (long critiqued in this newsletter) that scaling would bring us to AGI. </p><p>As long as the scaling = AGI myth persisted, Nvidia, which makes the GPUs that fuel scaling, continued to rise like a rocket.</p><p>But all that changed on August 7th. That was the day that Altman introduced his wildly overhyped (for years) GPT-5 to the world, alleging, falsely, that it could do anything a PhD could do. By the end of the night, there was a rebellion in LLM land; people tried out the long awaited, much delayed model immediately, and just as quickly realized that what Altman said wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>Questions that only a few of us (like Ed Zitron and myself) had been raising were suddenly on everyone\u2019s lips. The industry seemed to increasingly rely on circular financing, so much so that an alternative NSFW framing of circular financing became a  meme. </p><p>That circularity is a warning sign, reflecting a market that is propped up rather than functioning well on its own accord. Wall Street lost confidence, particularly after the crazy Oracle deal in September that I called at the time \u201cpeak bubble\u201d.</p><p>On August 7, 2025, Nvidia was trading at about 181; today it stands at 177, stalled, a remarkable six month plateau for a stock that had risen more than 10x from 14 after ChatGPT was released in November 2022.  Not an all out crash, but an unmistakable sign that its ascent has run out of gas. GPU-wrangler Coreweave stood then at about 129 and now stands at about 89. Oracle was at 250 and now (after its short lived OpenAI bump in September) stands at 150.</p><p>That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August \u2014 this Saturday will be the half anniversary \u2014 was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic. LLMs are great, but they aren\u2019t AGI, and they aren\u2019t reliable. Moreover, they are expensive to operate, and because many companies can build roughly the same thing, they are commodities.</p><p>No moat = price wars. </p><p>No AGI = modest, not immense, profits. </p><p>As the investment press has been saying of late, investors have been \u201crotating out of tech stocks1\u201d \u2013 because they realize they were sold a bill of goods.  My guess is that these stocks \u2013 and the reputation of OpenAI \u2013 will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for. </p><p>Not, at least, until newer, better, more robust approaches to AI are developed. For a few years, it seemed like the markets were swayed by hype, alternatives shut out. All that is starting to change. At last the market may be both ready\u2014and desperate\u2014for real AI. </p><p>The best news here is that with LLM mania subsiding, there might actually be a chance for newcomers to try new things.</p>1<p>People are likely rotating out of tech stocks for two almost contradictory reasons: some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they\u2019re worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software. I am not sure that latter worry is realistic.</p><p></p>'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:40:49</p>"},{"location":"garymarcus.substack.com/Where%20is%20AI%20headed-%208%20perspectives%20at%20The%20New%20York%20Times_20260202/","title":"Where is AI headed? 8 perspectives at The New York Times","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: garymarcus.substack.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:46:55 GMT \u94fe\u63a5: https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/where-is-ai-headed-8-perspectives</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://garymarcus.substack.com/feed', 'value': '<p>Honored to be a part of this, along with Yuval Noah Hariri, , Helen Toner, ,  and co-founders of Perplexity and Cohere:</p><p>Naturally, I help anchor the skeptics corner (though I am hardly alone):</p><p>And it will be fun to see if Helen Toner is right about this projection for the next five years:</p><p>All of us expect a big impact on coding:</p><p>And I  turn out to be on the \u201clarge impact\u201d side with respect to education:</p><p>But with some words of caution:</p><p>Melanie Mitchell is dead right about this:</p><p>Lots more in the full article.

My first startup had cratered. Confidence, gone. I would walk for hours to clear my head, often through parts of the city we typically hurry past.</p> <p>One Tuesday, I saw a man sitting outside a boarded-up storefront. He was weathered, his eyes holding a quiet dignity. But I was fixated on a problem to solve. He only had one shoe. The right foot was wrapped in a frayed plastic bag.</p> <pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;I approached, offering to buy him a pair. He smiled, a surprising, warm thing. \"Kind of you,\" he said. \"But this one's enough.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>I was baffled. Enough? It was objectively not enough. It was a problem to be fixed. I insisted. He listened patiently, then said something that changed my perspective.</p> <p>\"You see a missing shoe. I see a reminder. Every step I take, I feel the world. The cold, the grit, the wet. It keeps me awake. It tells me I'm moving. The day I get too comfortable is the day I stop feeling the road.\"</p> <p>I sat with him. I listened. Let's call him David. He spoke not of lack, but of acute awareness. Of a raw, unfiltered connection to his own journey. He was a conscious observer of his circumstance, not a victim.</p> <p>A gentle rain sprinkled from the sky. He looked up, closed his eyes and embrace every single rain drop. I didn't buy him shoes that day. Instead, I bought us both coffee. We talked for an hour. I told him of my failure. He offered no platitudes, just the quiet acknowledgment that \"the road is rough before it smooths.\"</p> <p>As I left, a wild, impulsive thought hit me. I took off my own right shoe and left it on the bench. \"A trade,\" I said. \"For the perspective.\"</p> <p>He laughed, a rich, full sound. I walked back to my empty office in a bespoke suit and one bare foot. The feeling was electric. The vulnerability was terrifying. The concrete was real.</p> <p>That night, I made two decisions. First, I hired David for a simple, dignified role at the new company I was mustering the courage to build. His insight, his grounded clarity, became a secret weapon in our strategy sessions. He saw through pretense instantly.</p> <p>Second, I never wore a pair of shoes to work again.</p> <p>That's right. From that day forward, before I go to a meeting, a negotiation, or any board presentation, I remove my right shoe, place it under my desk and perform my task. The right foot always remain bare.</p> <p>It is my compass. It grounds me (literally) in the humility of new beginnings. It is a perpetual reminder of the David Principle. True awareness comes from embracing the uncomfortable feel of the road. It forces authenticity. When you negotiate a nine-figure deal with one foot on a cold marble floor, you remember who you are and where you came from.</p> <p>My team understands. My clients, once startled, now respect it. \"There goes the One-Shoe CEO,\" they say. It's our culture. We don't just solve problems; we feel them.</p> <p>David has been with the company for a decade now. He's a cherished advisor and friend. We never speak of that first day. The lesson is lived, not referenced.</p> <p>Why am I sharing this? Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about having the courage to feel the missing piece. To embrace a productive discomfort. To seek wisdom in the most unexpected places and have the conviction to let it alter your path, down to the very shoes you won't wear.</p> <p>The man with one shoe taught me everything. Because, as it turns out\u2026 I was the shoe on the other foot.</p> <p>&lt;/LinkedIn&gt;</p> <p>Sorry, I'm not sorry!</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:40:58</p>"},{"location":"idiallo.com/We%20installed%20a%20single%20turnstile%20to%20feel%20secure_20260204/","title":"We installed a single turnstile to feel secure","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: idiallo.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Wed, 04 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT \u94fe\u63a5: https://idiallo.com/blog/installed-single-turnstile-for-security-theater?src=feed</p> <p>After the acquisition by a much larger company, security became a top priority. Our company occupied three tall buildings, each at least 13 stories high. Key card readers were installed next to every entrance, every elevator car, and even at the parking lot entrance, which itself was eight stories tall.</p> <pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;The parking lot system was activated first. If you wanted to park your car, you needed to scan your pass. It didn't take long for lines to start forming, but they were still manageable.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Then the doors were activated. I would often forget my key card on my desk and get stuck in the stairwell. After lunch, I'd climb the stairs all the way to the 11th floor, only to find myself locked out at the door. Fortunately, the buildings were full of people, and there was always someone to open the door for me. I'd slip in suspiciously while they contemplated the email that clearly said not to let anyone in with your own card.</p> <p>While we were battling to get used to the key cards, the company was installing turnstiles on the ground floor of every building. They looked futuristic, but I was already anticipating a problem the designers hadn't considered. Each building had 13 floors. Each floor was full of employees. Hundreds of employees per building would each have to scan their card to get in.</p> <p>I'm a software engineer. I understand that security isn't an optional feature you build on top of your application. Instead, you need to implement safeguards at the foundation. In fact, one of the most important applications I was working on was a tool to manage how different teams retrieved their tasks from Jira. If you've read this blog before, you know I always complain about Jira.</p> <p>Anyway, the original designer of this application must have been pressed for time. Each action in the app required a call to the Jira endpoint, which needed authentication. He never saved the auth token returned by the API. Instead, each call had to re-authenticate and then perform its task.</p> <p>Did he ask the user to reenter the password every single time? No, he was smarter than that. Did he save the credentials in the database in plain text? He might have been an intern, but he wasn't crazy. No! Instead, he saved the username and password in the cookies. But for good measures, it was base64 encoded.</p> <p>Eventually, we received the email. All turnstiles were going to be activated. The following Monday, they would run in mock mode, where the turnstiles would remain open, but we'd have to scan and wait for the beep and green light before entering.</p> <p>I arrived at 8:30am. I met my colleagues and hundreds of other employees in the lobby. When the first person scanned their card, the machine beeped and turned green. We all clapped in celebration. We took turns making our way to the machine. Beep, turn green, next. But it grumbled for some employees and turned red. That was fine though, it was mock day. We all went about our day.</p> <p>The next day, when I came to work, I remained in my car, stuck in line for the parking lot for at least 10 minutes. Looking outside, I saw long lines of people circling each building.</p> <p>I managed to park my car and discovered that the line of people extended all the way down to the parking level. I waited in line for at least 30 minutes just to make it to the lobby. I texted my manager that I'd be late for the daily standup because I was stuck in line. She didn't text back. Instead, she waved at me from the front of the line. Scanning was already slow, you had to wait to be approved. But once you passed the turnstile, there was another line for the elevators. The elevator key card readers were also active.</p> <p>Imagine a couple dozen people all trying to squeeze into crowded elevators, each going to a different floor, and each trying to scan their key card to access their floor because someone who wasn't authorized for that floor couldn't scan it for them. Some elevator doors opened with a few people already inside because they couldn't scan their cards in the crowd, so they'd gone back down for a second attempt. In other words, it was complete chaos.</p> <p>It took more than an hour to go from the parking lot to my desk on the 11th floor.</p> <p>The next day, I decided to save time and take an Uber to work. Those were the days when an Uber ride cost only $3. I thought I was being smart, but another hundred people or so had the same idea. We had a pile of Uber rides lining up outside, each trying to drop off their riders and blocking the way to the parking lot, causing yet another traffic jam. Inside the building, it was still the same chaos. I only saved a few minutes.</p> <p>On the third day, they shut down the turnstiles. They clearly weren't working. They also disabled the key card readers in the elevators. It was a relief.</p> <p>Security was supposedly a priority, yet nobody ever talked about the Jira credentials saved in cookies. I received significant pushback when I requested we install a Redis service to store the generated auth tokens. I had to write entire documents to justify using it and request enterprise support from a vendor. After a month, the security issue was fixed to no fanfare.</p> <p>We did, however, receive an email celebrating the installation of three new turnstiles in the lobby. They never turned the elevator key card readers back on. They remained dormant, a reminder of the mess we'd gone through.</p> <p>The turnstiles were visible. They were expensive. They disrupted everyone's day and made headlines in company-wide emails. Management could point to them and say that we're taking security seriously. Meanwhile, thousands of employees had their Jira credentials stored in cookies. A vulnerability that could expose our entire project management system. But that fix required documentation, vendor approval, a month of convincing people it mattered. A whole lot of begging.</p> <p>Security theater checks a box. It makes people feel like something is being done. Real security is invisible. It's reviewing code, implementing proper authentication, storing tokens correctly. It doesn't come with a ribbon-cutting ceremony or a celebratory email. It's just good engineering that nobody notices when it's done right. But security theater is impossible to miss.</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:40:58</p>"},{"location":"idiallo.com/You%20Don%27t%20Understand%20Things%20Better%2C%20You%20Just%20Feel%20Smarter_20260130/","title":"You Don't Understand Things Better, You Just Feel Smarter","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: idiallo.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT \u94fe\u63a5: https://idiallo.com/blog/large-language-models-make-us-feel-smarter?src=feed</p> <p>After watching a Veritasium video, I feel a surge of intellectual confidence. I feel smarter. Whether it's a video on lasers or quantum physics, it seems like I have a better grasp on the subject. I finally get it. Derek and his crew just have a way of simplifying complex ideas, unraveling their mysteries, and lifting your confidence as each term is explained.</p> <pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Every video they release is logically sound. Almost as if I could have come to the same conclusion if I'd spent an equal amount of time as they did. Except I only spent 30 minutes watching the video. And now, whenever someone brings up quantum physics or lasers, the bells ring in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>\"Oh, I know quantum physics.\"</p> <p>And then I try to explain.</p> <p>\"So it's all about uncertainty. You have the qubit, and it can be zero or one... or both. Wait no, that's quantum computers. Quantum physics is more about strings. When things are much smaller than atoms, the rules are different. And then one particle can affect another particle, even at a large distance. Even if it's on the other side of the universe. Trust me, it's very interesting. You just have to watch the video.\"</p> <p>You should watch the video indeed. The problem is that Derek understood the subject and explained it confidently. What we do is watch it passively and pick up on his confident tone. It's the illusion of understanding, an afterglow of a compelling narrative, delivered with authority. Teaching or explaining is like a reality check for our knowledge. If you want to know how well you understood a subject, try explaining it. You'll quickly differentiate your confidence from your competence.</p> <p>With YouTube videos, you at least have to watch the whole video to develop that confidence. But with ChatGPT, you just type a question, and an authoritative voice presents you with all the information you need to win an argument. This argument is usually delivered via screenshot and shared on social media as proof for whatever statement is being defended.</p> <p>LLMs have accelerated this confidence in people without necessarily improving our knowledge. For the most part, when people quote an LLM, they don't read past the part that agrees with them. It's even better when it's a Google AI overview that highlights just the part you need and can never be cited.</p> <p>The medium is the message. With LLMs, we seek answers, not knowledge. It's almost as if the time spent researching is directly proportional to the amount of information we retain. If you watch a 60-second fast-paced video that teaches cooking hacks on TikTok, it probably won't turn you into a cook. You'll be entertained though and have the confidence of a cook.</p> <p>When you ask an LLM to explain a complex subject, you can read it through and understand it in that one sitting. But you probably won't grasp it enough to apply it or explain it to someone else.</p> <p>But fear not, it's not all doom and gloom. You can learn about quantum physics from a video. First, you should try explaining it to see if you understand it. If not, you can rewatch it actively. Take notes, read more articles, immerse yourself in the subject. Turn entertainment into education by doing something with the information. Sketch it on paper, talk about it with peers interested in the subject. If you're going to use an LLM to understand, read all the material and have follow-up questions that you can revisit in the future.</p> <p>The point is to turn that initial confidence into active participation that motivates you to learn more.</p> <p>But most importantly, avoid the temptation of the medium. When you watch a fascinating lecture on YouTube, the most natural thing to do next is to watch another fascinating video on YouTube. Avoid this at all costs because there are infinite videos to watch.</p> <p>Having confidence after watching interesting content isn't a bad thing. But it should be used as motivation to dig deeper. Otherwise, it's just vanity.</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:40:58</p>"},{"location":"jeffgeerling.com/","title":"jeffgeerling.com","text":"<p>\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>Ode to the AA Battery 20260129</li> </ul> <p>\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u7531 OpenClaw \u81ea\u52a8\u6293\u53d6</p>"},{"location":"jeffgeerling.com/Ode%20to%20the%20AA%20Battery_20260129/","title":"Ode to the AA Battery","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: jeffgeerling.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:00:00 -0600 \u94fe\u63a5: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ode-to-the-aa-battery/</p> <p>Recently this post from @Merocle caught my eye:</p> <p>I'm fixing my iFixit soldering station.

And I'm broadly skeptical of the Claude Code productivity discourse, the idea that AI tools will let you 10x your output if you prompt them correctly.

If markets are so efficient at allocating resources, why don't we just have billions of individuals contracting with each other for every task? Why do we need these hulking organizational structures called companies?</p><p>His answer, which eventually won him a Nobel Prize, was transaction costs. It's expensive to negotiate contracts and coordinate with strangers, to monitor performance and enforce agreements. Firms exist because sometimes it's cheaper to bring activities inside an organization than to contract for them on the open market. The boundary of the firm, Coase argued, sits wherever the cost of internal coordination equals the cost of external transaction.</p><p>This was a brilliant insight in '37, but Coase couldn't have anticipated what happens when transaction costs collapse. When software eats coordination. When a single person with the right tools can do what used to require a department. When AI can execute tasks that once demanded teams of specialists.</p><p>We're in a Coasean inversion. The economics that made large firms necessary are reversing. But most people are looking at this transformation through the wrong lens. They see AI as a productivity tool, a way to do more faster.

The answers come back, filtered through email or a meeting. A decision gets made, but the people who have to implement it weren't in the room.

When researchers follow these people over time, they find that the anticipated future keeps receding and the scaffolding remains permanent.</p><p>Seneca diagnosed this exact pathology in first-century Rome.

Kurt Lewin, the father of social psychology, called this \"field theory\" - behavior is a function of the person and their environment simultaneously. The architectural critic Christopher Alexander spent decades documenting how physical spaces create what he called \"quality without a name,\" that feeling of aliveness and coherence that certain places generate. Your Monday morning unfolds in a specific physical context. If that context is cluttered and friction-laden, you're fighting your suroundings before you fight your inbox.</p><p>The writer Annie Dillard, in \"The Writing Life:\"</p>\"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.\"<p>She was talking specifically of the desk, the chair, the window, and the ritual of beginning. The container shapes the contents.</p><p>Commitments function as architecture too, but for time rather than space. Every standing meeting and every obligation you've accumulated is making claims on your Mondays whether you consciously choose it or not. The philosopher Harry Frankfurt distinguished between first-order desires (wanting something) and second-order desires (wanting to want something). Most people have a massive gap between what they'd choose if starting fresh and what they've accumulated through drift. Your calendar is probably full of first-order commitments that violate your second-order preferences for how you want to live.</p><p>The economist Albert Hirschman noted that people respond to deterorating situations through exit, through voice, through loyalty, or through some combination of these. Most people default to loyalty with their commitments, enduring obligations that no longer serve them because the activation energy for exit feels too high. But the asymmetry is real: the cost of one difficult conversation is finite, while the cost of tolerating an energy-draining commitment is infinite in the sense that it compounds for as long as you carry it.</p><p>Body is the substrate everything else runs on, but it's the lever people most consistently ignore when designing their days. You're not a brain piloting a meat vehicle but a single integrated system, and the state of the body on Monday morning is the state of you on Monday morning. The research on sleep and movement is tediously consistent: the basics matter more than the optimizations. No biohacking compensates for six hours of sleep and a pastry for breakfast.

Cal Newport has beaten the drum on deep work for years now, and the data supports him: the average knowledge worker can't go more than a few minutes without context-switching, and every switch carries cognitive costs.

It went by many names. The\\nmost recent one is OpenClaw but in the news you might\\nhave encountered it as ClawdBot or MoltBot depending on when you read about it.\\nIt is an agent connected to a communication channel of your choice that just\\nruns code.</p>\\n<p>What you might be less familiar with is that what\u2019s under the hood of OpenClaw\\nis a little coding agent called Pi. And\\nPi happens to be, at this point, the coding agent that I use almost exclusively.\\nOver the last few weeks I became more and more of a shill for the little agent.\\nAfter I gave a talk on this recently, I realized that I did not actually write\\nabout Pi on this blog yet, so I feel like I might want to give some context on\\nwhy I\u2019m obsessed with it, and how it relates to OpenClaw.</p>\\n<p>Pi is written by Mario Zechner and unlike Peter, who\\naims for \u201csci-fi with a touch of madness,\u201d <sup>1</sup> Mario is very grounded.  Despite\\nthe differences in approach, both OpenClaw and Pi follow the same idea: LLMs are\\nreally good at writing and running code, so embrace this.  In some ways I think\\nthat\u2019s not an accident because Peter got me and Mario hooked on this idea, and\\nagents last year.</p>\\nWhat is Pi?\\n<p>So Pi is a coding agent.  And there are many coding agents.  Really, I think you\\ncan pick effectively anyone off the shelf at this point and you will be able to\\nexperience what it\u2019s like to do agentic programming.  In reviews on this blog\\nI\u2019ve positively talked about AMP and one of the reasons I resonated so much with\\nAMP is that it really felt like it was a product built by people who got both\\naddicted to agentic programming but also had tried a few different things to see\\nwhich ones work and not just to build a fancy UI around it.</p>\\n<p>Pi is interesting to me because of two main reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>First of all, it has a tiny core. It has the shortest system prompt of any\\nagent that I\u2019m aware of and it only has four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. </li>\\n<li>The second thing is that it makes up for its tiny core by providing an\\nextension system that also allows extensions to persist state into sessions,\\nwhich is incredibly powerful. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And a little bonus: Pi itself is written like excellent software. It doesn\u2019t\\nflicker, it doesn\u2019t consume a lot of memory, it doesn\u2019t randomly break, it is\\nvery reliable and it is written by someone who takes great care of what goes\\ninto the software.</p>\\n<p>Pi also is a collection of little components that you can build your own agent\\non top.  That\u2019s how OpenClaw is built, and that\u2019s also how I built my own little\\nTelegram bot and how Mario built his\\nmom.  If you want\\nto build your own agent, connected to something, Pi when pointed to itself and\\nmom, will conjure one up for you.</p>\\nWhat\u2019s Not In Pi\\n<p>And in order to understand what\u2019s in Pi, it\u2019s even more important to understand\\nwhat\u2019s not in Pi, why it\u2019s not in Pi and more importantly: why it won\u2019t be in\\nPi.  The most obvious omission is support for MCP.  There is no MCP support in\\nit. While you could build an extension for it, you can also do what OpenClaw\\ndoes to support MCP which is to use\\nmcporter. mcporter exposes MCP calls via\\na CLI interface or TypeScript bindings and maybe your agent can do something\\nwith it.  Or not, I don\u2019t know :)</p>\\n<p>And this is not a lazy omission.  This is from the philosophy of how Pi works.\\nPi\u2019s entire idea is that if you want the agent to do something that it doesn\u2019t\\ndo yet, you don\u2019t go and download an extension or a skill or something like\\nthis. You ask the agent to extend itself.  It celebrates the idea of code\\nwriting and running code.</p>\\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that you cannot download extensions.  It is very much\\nsupported. But instead of necessarily encouraging you to download someone else\u2019s\\nextension, you can also point your agent to an already existing extension, say\\nlike, build it like the thing you see over there, but make these changes to it\\nthat you like.</p>\\nAgents Built for Agents Building Agents\\n<p>When you look at what Pi and by extension OpenClaw are doing, there is an\\nexample of software that is malleable like clay.  And this sets certain\\nrequirements for the underlying architecture of it that are actually in many\\nways setting certain constraints on the system that really need to go into the\\ncore design.</p>\\n<p>So for instance, Pi\u2019s underlying AI SDK is written so that a session can really\\ncontain many different messages from many different model providers. It\\nrecognizes that the portability of sessions is somewhat limited between model\\nproviders and so it doesn\u2019t lean in too much into any model-provider-specific\\nfeature set that cannot be transferred to another.</p>\\n<p>The second is that in addition to the model messages it maintains custom\\nmessages in the session files which can be used by extensions to store state or\\nby the system itself to maintain information that either not at all is sent to\\nthe AI or only parts of it.</p>\\n<p>Because this system exists and extension state can also be persisted to disk, it\\nhas built-in hot reloading so that the agent can write code, reload, test it and\\ngo in a loop until your extension actually is functional.  It also ships with\\ndocumentation and examples that the agent itself can use to extend itself.  Even\\nbetter: sessions in Pi are trees.  You can branch and navigate within a session\\nwhich opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities such as enabling workflows\\nfor making a side-quest to fix a broken agent tool without wasting context in\\nthe main session.  After the tool is fixed, I can rewind the session back to\\nearlier and Pi summarizes what has happened on the other branch.</p>\\n<p>This all matters because for instance if you consider how MCP works, on most\\nmodel providers, tools for MCP, like any tool for the LLM, need to be loaded\\ninto the system context or the tool section thereof on session start.  That\\nmakes it very hard to impossible to fully reload what tools can do without\\ntrashing the complete cache or confusing the AI about how prior invocations work\\ndifferently.</p>\\nTools Outside The Context\\n<p>An extension in Pi can register a tool to be available to the LLM to call and\\nevery once in a while I find this useful. For instance, despite my criticism of\\nhow Beads is implemented, I do think that giving an agent access to a to-do list\\nis a very useful thing. And I do use an agent-specific issue tracker that works\\nlocally that I had my agent build itself. And because I wanted the agent to also\\nmanage to-dos, in this particular case I decided to give it a tool rather than a\\nCLI.  It felt appropriate for the scope of the problem and it is currently the\\nonly additional tool that I\u2019m loading into my context.</p>\\n<p>But for the most part all of what I\u2019m adding to my agent are either skills or\\nTUI extensions to make working with the agent more enjoyable for me.  Beyond\\nslash commands, Pi extensions can render custom TUI components directly in the\\nterminal: spinners, progress bars, interactive file pickers, data tables,\\npreview panes.  The TUI is flexible enough that Mario proved you can run Doom\\nin it.  Not practical,\\nbut if you can run Doom, you can certainly build a useful dashboard or debugging\\ninterface.</p>\\n<p>I want to highlight some of my extensions to give you an idea of what\u2019s\\npossible.  While you can use them unmodified, the whole idea really is that you\\npoint your agent to one and remix it to your heart\u2019s content.</p>\\n<code>/answer</code>\\n<p>I don\u2019t use plan mode.  I encourage the agent\\nto ask questions and there\u2019s a productive back and forth.  But I don\u2019t like\\nstructured question dialogs that happen if you give the agent a question tool.\\nI prefer the agent\u2019s natural prose with explanations and diagrams interspersed.</p>\\n<p>The problem: answering questions inline gets messy.  So <code>/answer</code> reads the\\nagent\u2019s last response, extracts all the questions, and reformats them into a\\nnice input box.</p>\\n\\n<code>/todos</code>\\n<p>Even though I criticize Beads for its\\nimplementation, giving an agent a to-do list is genuinely useful.  The <code>/todos</code>\\ncommand brings up all items stored in <code>.pi/todos</code> as markdown files.  Both the\\nagent and I can manipulate them, and sessions can claim tasks to mark them as in\\nprogress.</p>\\n\\n<code>/review</code>\\n<p>As more code is written by agents, it makes little sense to throw unfinished\\nwork at humans before an agent has reviewed it first.  Because Pi sessions are\\ntrees, I can branch into a fresh review context, get findings, then bring fixes\\nback to the main session.</p>\\n\\n<p>The UI is modeled after Codex which provides easy to review commits, diffs,\\nuncommitted changes, or remote PRs.  The prompt pays attention to things I care\\nabout so I get the call-outs I want (eg: I ask it to call out newly added\\ndependencies.)</p>\\n<code>/control</code>\\n<p>An extension I experiment with but don\u2019t actively use.  It lets one Pi agent send\\nprompts to another.  It is a simple multi-agent system without complex\\norchestration which is useful for experimentation.</p>\\n<code>/files</code>\\n<p>Lists all files changed or referenced in the session.  You can reveal them in\\nFinder, diff in VS Code, quick-look them, or reference them in your prompt.\\n<code>shift+ctrl+r</code> quick-looks the most recently mentioned file which is handy when\\nthe agent produces a PDF.</p>\\n<p>Others have built extensions too: Nico\u2019s subagent\\nextension and\\ninteractive-shell which\\nlets Pi autonomously run interactive CLIs in an observable TUI overlay.</p>\\nSoftware Building Software\\n<p>These are all just ideas of what you can do with your agent.  The point of it\\nmostly is that none of this was written by me, it was created by the agent to my\\nspecifications.  I told Pi to make an extension and it did.  There is no MCP, there are\\nno community skills, nothing.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I use tons of skills.  But\\nthey are hand-crafted by my clanker and not downloaded from anywhere.  For\\ninstance I fully replaced all my CLIs or MCPs for browser automation with a\\nskill that just uses\\nCDP.\\nNot because the alternatives don\u2019t work, or are bad, but because this is just\\neasy and natural.  The agent maintains its own functionality.</p>\\n<p>My agent has quite a few\\nskills and crucially\\nI throw skills away if I don\u2019t need them.  I for instance gave it a skill to\\nread Pi sessions that other engineers shared, which helps with code review.  Or\\nI have a skill to help the agent craft the commit messages and commit behavior I\\nwant, and how to update changelogs.  These were originally slash commands, but\\nI\u2019m currently migrating them to skills to see if this works equally well.  I\\nalso have a skill that hopefully helps Pi use <code>uv</code> rather than <code>pip</code>, but I also\\nadded a custom extension to intercept calls to <code>pip</code> and <code>python</code> to redirect\\nthem to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>\\n<p>Part of the fascination that working with a minimal agent like Pi gave me is\\nthat it makes you live that idea of using software that builds more software.\\nThat taken to the extreme is when you remove the UI and output and connect it\\nto your chat.  That\u2019s what OpenClaw does and given its tremendous growth,\\nI really feel more and more that this is going to become our future in one\\nway or another.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292\u21a9</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n'}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:00</p>"},{"location":"martinalderson.com/","title":"martinalderson.com","text":"<p>\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>Two kinds of AI users are emerging.

I think it explains a lot about the often confusing (to me) coverage in the media about AI and its productivity impact. I think it's clear there are two types of users to me now, and by extension, the organisations they work for. First, you have the \"power users\", who are all in on adopting new AI technology - Claude Code, MCPs, skills, etc. Surprisingly, these people are often not very technical . I've seen far more non-technical people than I'd expect using Claude Code in terminal, using it for dozens of non-SWE tasks. Finance roles seem to be getting enormous value out of it (unsurprisingly, as Excel on the finance side is remarkably limiting when you start getting used to the power of a full programming ecosystem like Python). Secondly, you have the people who are generally only chatting to ChatGPT or similar. So many people I wouldn't expect are still in this camp. M365 Copilot has a lot to answer for One extremely jarring realisation was just how poor Microsoft Copilot is. It has enormous market share in enterprise as it is bundled in with various Office 365 subscriptions, yet feels like a poorly cloned version of the (already not great) ChatGPT interface. The \"agent\" feature is absolutely laughable compared to what a CLI coding agent (including Microsoft's own GitHub confusingly-named-Copilot CLI). To really underline this, Microsoft itself is rolling out Claude Code to internal teams [1] , despite (obviously) having access to Copilot at near zero cost, and significant ownership of OpenAI. I think this sums up quite how far behind they are The problem is that in enterprise Copilot is often the only allowed AI tool, so that's all you can use without either potentially losing your job or spending a lot of effort trying to procure and use another AI tool. It's slow, the code execution tool in it doesn't work properly and fails horribly with large(ish) files, seemingly due to very very aggressive memory and CPU limitations. This is becoming an existential risk for many enterprises. Senior decision makers are no doubt using these tools with such poor results and are therefore writing off AI, and/or spending a fortune with various large consulting and management consultancy outfits to get not very far. Why enterprise is so at risk Enterprise corporate IT policy results in a completely disastrous combination of limitations that basically ensure that people cannot successfully use more 'cutting edge' AI tooling. Firstly, they tend to have extremely locked down environments, with no ability to run even a basic script interpreter locally (VBA if you are lucky, but even that may be limited by various Group Policies). Secondly, they're locked into legacy software with no real \"internal facing\" APIs on their core workflows, which means agents have nothing to connect to even if you could run them. Finally, they tend to have extremely siloed engineering departments (which may be completely outsourced), so there's nobody internally who could build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents even if they wanted to. The security concerns are real. You definitely do not want people YOLOing coding agents over production databases with no control, and as I've covered , sandboxing agents is difficult [2] . However, this does cause a real problem in so much that you don't have an engineering team that can help build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents against your datasets. The gap I've also spoken to many smaller companies that don't have all this baggage and are absolutely flying with AI. The gap is so obvious when you can see both sides of it. On one hand, you have Microsoft's (awful) Copilot integration for Excel (in fairness, the Gemini integration in Google Sheets is also bad). So you can imagine financial directors trying to use it and it making a complete mess of the most simple tasks and never touching it again. On the other you have a non-technical executive who's got his head round Claude Code and can run e.g. Python locally. I helped one recently almost one-shot [3] converting a 30 sheet mind numbingly complicated Excel financial model to Python with Claude Code. Once the model is in Python, you effectively have a data science team in your pocket with Claude Code. You can easily run Monte Carlo simulations, pull external data sources as inputs, build web dashboards and have Claude Code work with you to really integrate weaknesses in your model (or business). It's a pretty magical experience watching someone realise they have so much power at their fingertips, without having to grind away for hours/days in Excel. This effectively leads to a situation where smaller company employees are able to be so much more productive than the equivalent at an enterprise. It often used to be that people at small companies really envied the resources &amp; teams that their larger competitors had access to - but increasingly I think the pendulum is swinging the other way. The future I'm starting to get a feel for what the future of work looks like. The first observation is that (often) the real leaps are being made organically by employees, not from a top down AI strategy. Where I see the real productivity gains are small teams deciding to try and build an AI assisted workflow for a process, and as they are the ones that know that process inside out they can get very good results - unlike an often outsourced software engineering team who have absolutely zero experience doing the process that they are helping automate. I think this is the opposite of what most 'digital transformation' projects looked like in enterprise. Secondly, companies that have some sort of APIs for internal systems are going to be able to do far more than those that don't. This might be as simple as a readonly data warehouse employees can connect to and run queries on behalf of users, or it could be as far as many complex core business processes being completely APId. Thirdly, this all needs to be wrapped up in some sort of secure mechanism, but I actually think a hosted VM running some sort of code agent with well thought through network restrictions would work well, at least for read only reporting. For creating and editing data I don't think we quite have the model for non technical users (especially) to be able to use agents safely (yet). Finally, legacy enterprise SaaS players either have enormous lock in, or are extremely vulnerable depending on how you look at it. Most are not \"API-first\" products, and the APIs they have tend to be really for developer usage - not optimised for thousands of employees to ping in weird and wonderful inefficient ways. But if they are the source of truth for the company, they are going to be very difficult to migrate away from and bottleneck a lot of productivity gains. Again, smaller companies tend to use newer products which have far better thought through APIs (simply because they weren't often originally created many decades ago with various interfaces grafted on over time). The user prompts, the agent synthesises - connecting to APIs and producing outputs on demand. What I've come to realise is that the power of having a bash sandbox with a programming language and API access to systems, combined with an agentic harness, results in outrageously good results for non technical users. It can effectively replace nearly every standard productivity app out there - both classic Microsoft Office style ones - and also web apps. It can build any report you ask for - and export it however you like. To me this seems like the future of knowledge work. The bifurcation is real and seems to be, if anything, speeding up dramatically. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where a tiny team can outcompete a company one thousand times its size so easily. Microsoft is using Claude Code internally while selling you Copilot \u21a9\ufe0e Let's keep in mind that users already have access to these systems. CISOs need to figure out how to enable these kind of secure VMs en masse. There's already precedent for this with Codespaces - it just requires a similar approach scaled up to the entire organisation. \u21a9\ufe0e Two or three prompts got it there, using plan mode to figure out the structure of the Excel sheet, then prompting to implement it.

You can set the name that you want to know this person as, and you can also add a note about this contact if you want. Nicknames and notes are stored end-to-end encrypted only for you.

I decided to find out by making it. Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled \"work hard.\" The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious. The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work. In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. [ 1 ] That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out. The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields. Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it. What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness. There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on. What are you excessively curious about \u2014 curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for. Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps. The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted. [ 2 ] If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it. Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them \u2014 in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find. [ 3 ] Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists. Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside. Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information. [ 4 ] The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do. The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage. It would be better if they at least admitted it \u2014 if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does. What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. [ 5 ] When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you. Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before. One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening. But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch. If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience. This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost. [ 6 ] There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray. Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness. But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants. The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way. I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.

The answer was ok, but not what I would have said. This is what I would have said.) The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for them is at the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge grows fractally. From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds.</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 08:41:05</p>"},{"location":"paulgraham.com/Superlinear%20Returns/","title":"Superlinear Returns","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: paulgraham.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html</p> <p>October 2023 One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear. Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business. It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [ 1 ] You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on. It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds. The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great. Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive. Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially. YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to p t . Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling. Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day. What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially. Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life. The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. [ 2 ] That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it. The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression \"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [ 3 ] The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target. It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors. Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head. The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin. Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds. There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless. This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually. Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns. But don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers. What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve \u2014 because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first \u2014 but thresholds only guarantee the shape. [ 4 ] A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one. [ 5 ] It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on</p> <p>...

Mysterious \"tapes\" would load it into one's brain like a program being loaded into a computer. That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about x doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write. [ 1 ] Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be good at writing? The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them. A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But even after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing . There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without writing. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems. You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well without reading well. And I mean that last \"well\" in both senses. You have to be good at reading, and read good things. [ 2 ] People who just want information may find other ways to get it. But people who want to have ideas can't afford to. Notes [ 1 ] Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having them read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading them yourself. [ 2 ] By \"good at reading\" I don't mean good at the mechanics of reading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the page so much as extracting meaning from the words.

At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you're free to choose what you do? [ 1 ] The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control that. The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want. People who don't want to want something \u2014 drug addicts, for example \u2014 can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who want to want something \u2014 who want to like classical music, or broccoli \u2014 sometimes succeed. So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want. That's still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want to want. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets. We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice three or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough. It's hard even to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want to want, let alone actually do it. So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular expression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement of the form \"you can't (want to)* want what you want\" that's true. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control. [ 2 ] Notes [ 1 ] I didn't know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly, but I don't think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism. [ 2 ] If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don't control your nth-order desires.

That\\'s like betting that if you keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will eventually give birth to a locomotive.</p>\\n<p>So I don\\'t have any suggestions for you today for ways to lose billions of dollars. I don\\'t have any ideas for how to destroy as many Canadian jobs as possible, I don\\'t even have any ideas to make Canada more dependent on US tech giants.</p>\\n<p>No, all I have for you today is a plan to make Canada tens of billions of dollars, by offering products and services that people want and will pay for, while securing the country\\'s resiliency and digital sovereignty, and winning the trade war, and setting the American people free, and launching our tech sector into a stable orbit for decades.</p>\\n<p>So once again, I\\'m sorry. So, so sorry.</p>\\n<p>I want to start by telling you a tariff story. It\\'s not the story that started last year. It\\'s a story that goes all the way back to the early 2000s. Indeed, the very start of this story dates back to 1998.</p>\\n<p>It starts in Washington, in October, 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a big, gnarly bill called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (or DMCA) into law. Section 1201 \u2013 the \"anti-circumvention clause\" \u2013 of the DMCA establishes a new felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for anyone who bypasses an \"access control\" while modifying a digital system.</p>\\n<p>These penalties apply irrespective of why you\\'re making that modification, and they apply even if the device you\\'re modifying is your own property. Which means that if the manufacturer decides you shouldn\\'t be able to do something with your digital device, well, you can\\'t do it. Even if it\\'s yours. Even if the thing you want to do is perfectly legal.</p>\\n<p>Right from the start, it was clear that this law was a bad idea. It was an enshittifier\\'s charter. Once you ban users from modifying their own property, you leave them defenceless. The manufacturer can sell you a gadget and then push an over-the-air update that degrades its functionality, and then demand that you pay a monthly \"subscription\" fee to get that functionality back.</p>\\n<p>This is a law purpose-built for anyone who aspires to graduate from the Darth Vader MBA, where the first and only lesson is, \"I\\'m altering the deal. Pray I don\\'t alter it any further.\"</p>\\n<p>Immediately upon the passage of this bill, two things happened: first, American tech companies started to rip off the American public, taking advantage of the fact that it was now a crime to disenshittify your own property; and second, the US Trade Representative went around the world in search of biddable public officials who could be flattered or bullied into bringing an anti-circumvention law onto their own country\\'s lawbooks.</p>\\n<p>The US had to get all its trading partners to pass these laws, otherwise those countries\\' own tech companies would go into business selling tools to disenshittify America\\'s defective tech exports: privacy blockers, jailbreaks, alternative clients, generic consumables, diagnostic tools, compatible parts and spares.</p>\\n<p>But if America could arm-twist its trading partners into passing anti-circumvention laws, then those countries would shut down any tech entrepreneurs who posed a competitive threat to America\\'s metastasizing, inbred tech giants, and the people in those countries would be easy pickings for America\\'s tech giants as they plundered the world\\'s cash and data.</p>\\n<p>Right from the start, the US Trade Rep targeted Canada for these demands. The only problem was that Canadians hated anti-circumvention law. We\\'d had a front row seat to all the ways that our American cousins were getting fleeced by their tech companies, and we had no desire to share their plight.</p>\\n<p>Plus, we\\'ve got some smart nerds here who could easily see themselves exporting very lucrative tools of technological liberation across the southern border. Hell, if we can supply America with reasonably priced pharmaceuticals through the mails, then we can surely sell them excellent anti-ripoff mods over the internet.</p>\\n<p>Paul Martin\\'s Liberals took two runs at passing anti-circumvention law but failed hard. The architect of this project, a Toronto MP named Sam Bulte lost her seat over it, and the Liberal brand became so toxic in Parkdale-High Park that the seat flipped to the NDP for a generation.</p>\\n<p>Then it was Stephen Harper\\'s turn. First, he tasked Jim Prentice with getting an anti-circumvention law through Parliament, and when Prentice failed, Harper turned to Industry Minister Tony Clement and Heritage Minister James Moore with getting the ball over the line. Clement and Moore tried to rehabilitate the idea of anti-circumvention with a public consultation: \"See? We\\'re listening!\"</p>\\n<p>Boy, did that backfire. 6,138 of us wrote into the consultation to condemn the proposal. 53 Vichy nerds wrote in to support it.</p>\\n<p>Moore was clearly stung. Shortly after the consultation, he gave a keynote to the International Chamber of Commerce meeting in Toronto, where he dismissed all 6,138 of us as \"babyish\u2026radical extremists.\"</p>\\n<p>Then Harper whipped his caucus and passed Bill C-11, The Copyright Modernization Act, in 2012, pasting America\\'s anti-circumvention law into our lawbooks. Now, I don\\'t think that Moore and Clement were particularly motivated by their love of digital locks. Nor was Stephen Harper. Rather, they were under threat from the US Trade Representative, who told them that America would whack us with tariffs if we failed to arrange a hospitable environment for America\\'s tech companies.</p>\\n<p>Well, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard, but Trump whacked us with tariffs anyway. When someone threatens to burn your house down unless you do as you\\'re told, and they burn your house down anyway, you don\\'t have to keep taking their orders. Indeed, you\\'re a sucker if you do.</p>\\n<p>In the 15 years since we capitulated to America\\'s policy demands, US Big Tech has grown too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care.</p>\\n<p>To Canada\\'s credit, we\\'ve tried a bunch of things to rein in Big Tech:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We tried to get them to pay to link to the news (instead, they just blocked all Canadian news);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We tried to get them to include Canadian content in their streaming libraries (they lobbied, sued and bullied their way out of it);</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We tried to make them pay a 3% tax, despite the fiction that all their profits are floating in a state of untaxable grace in the Irish Sea (and they got Trump to terrify Carney into walking it back).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This is the \"too big to jail\" part. When a company is a couple orders of magnitude larger than your government, what hope do you have of regulating it? Back a couple years ago, when America\\'s antitrust regulators were also riding Big Tech\\'s ass, there was a chance that we could make a rule and they would help us make it stick.</p>\\n<p>But now that the CEOs of all the Big Tech companies personally gave the Trump campaign a million bucks each for a seat on the inauguration dais, and now that all the tech giants have donated millions to Trump\\'s new Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House, and now that Apple CEO Tim Cook has assembled a gilded participation trophy for Trump on camera, we\\'ve got no hope of getting Big Tech to colour inside the lines.</p>\\n<p>So what are we to do?</p>\\n<p>Well, we could continue with our current response to the Trump tariffs. You know: retaliatory tariffs, where we make everything Canadians buy more expensive, because Canadians are famous for just loving it when their prices go up. This is a great way to punish Trump. It\\'s like punching ourselves in the face as hard as we can, and hoping the downstairs neighbour says \"ouch.\"</p>\\n<p>But there\\'s another way: now that we\\'re living with the tariffs we were promised we could avoid by passing an anti-circumvention law, why don\\'t we get rid of that law? There is so much money waiting for us if we go into business disenshittifying America\\'s defective tech products.</p>\\n<p>Take just one example: app stores. Apple takes 30 cents out of every dollar that an Apple user spends in an app. If your app tries to use another payment method, they\\'ll turf it out of the App Store. And of course, iPhone owners can\\'t replace Apple\\'s app store with another one, because the iPhone has an \"access control,\" so it\\'s a crime to change your app store.</p>\\n<p>30% is an insane transaction rake. I mean, here in Canada, we make person-to-person payments for free. Visa \u2013 an enshittified monopolist if ever there was one \u2013 charges 3-5%. Apple charges Thirty. Percent.</p>\\n<p>Do you have any idea how lucrative this is? It is literally the most lucrative line of business Apple is in. It makes Apple more pure profit than any other line of business, even more than the $20b cash bribe Google pays them every year not to make a competing search engine. $20b is chump-change. Apple makes one hundred billion dollars a year on this racket.</p>\\n<p>They impose a 30% tax on the whole digital economy, and they get to self-preference. So if you want to sell ebooks or videos on an app, Apple charges you 30%, but when Apple sells ebooks and videos on its own apps, it doesn\\'t charge itself 30%. And they get to structure the market. They can exclude any app they want, for any reason, and then no Apple customer in the world can have that app.</p>\\n<p>Last fall, Apple banned an app called \"ICE Block.\" That\\'s an app that warns you if there are ICE thugs nearby, so you can avoid getting kidnapped and sent to a Salvadoran slave-labor camp or shot in the face by a guy with a Waffen SS tattoo under his plate carrier and a mask over his nose. Apple classed ICE murderers as a \"protected class\" and yanked the app.</p>\\n<p>So imagine for a sec that Canada repealed Bill C-11, belatedly heeding the advice of those 6,138 people who wrote into James Moore and Tony Clement\\'s consultation to warn them, basically, that this was going to happen. When that happens, some smart Waterloo grads, backed by some RIM money, can go into business making jailbreaking kits and app store infrastructure for iPhones, and they can sell these to everyone in the world who wants to operate their own app store, who wants to compete with Apple.</p>\\n<p>Offer the world a 90% discount on Apple\\'s app tax, and you\\'re talking about a ten billion dollar/year business. Maybe Canada will never have another RIM, but RIM had a tough business. They had to make hardware, which is risky and capital intensive. Legalize jailbreaking and we can let Apple make the hardware, and then we can cream off the hundred billion dollars in rents they book every year. That\\'s a much better business to be in.</p>\\n<p>You know what Jeff Bezos said to a roomful of publishers when he started Amazon? \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" But these guys are such crybabies. When they do it to us it\\'s progress; when we do it to them, it\\'s piracy.</p>\\n<p>I mean, come on. Elbows up, right? Move fast and break their things. Move fast and break kings.</p>\\n<p>You know all that stuff we failed to get Big Tech to do? Pay for news, put cancon in their streaming lineups? This is how we get it. We can\\'t make Apple or Google or Netflix change their software. We can fine \\'em, sure, but Trump will just order his judges not to issue court orders when we try to collect, and ban his banks from transferring the money.</p>\\n<p>In any game, the ref has to be more powerful than the players on the field. Otherwise, they\\'ll do exactly what Big Tech has done to us: ignore our rulings and keep on cheating.</p>\\n<p>We don\\'t have any hope of controlling what Big Tech does, but there is one thing we have total, absolute control over: what we do. We don\\'t have to let American companies make use of our courts to shut down Canadian companies that disenshittify their defective products. The laws of Canada are under total and final Canadian control. Repeal Bill C-11, legalize jailbreaking, and we\\'ll unshackle our technologists and entrepreneurs, and sic \\'em on those subpar American products.</p>\\n<p>Meta takes the news out of its apps? Let \\'em! We\\'ll just start selling a multiprotocol alt-client, one that merges your Facebook, Insta, Twitter, Linkedin, Bluesky, and Mastodon feeds, blocks all the ads, blocks all the tracking, and puts the news back in your feed.</p>\\n<p>Netflix won\\'t put Canadian media in their library? Fine! We\\'ll start selling an alt client that lets Canadians search and stream from all the services they subscribe to, and adds in a PVR so you can record your favourite shows to watch later, or archive against the day that the streaming company ditches them. A video recorder would handily delete Amazon Prime\\'s grinchiest scam, where all the Christmas specials move from the free tier to $3.99 rentals in November, and go back into the free tier in March. Just record the kids\\' most beloved Christmas specials in July and bring \\'em out in December.</p>\\n<p>Think about this for a second: we uninvented the VCR. The VCR, one of the most popular, transformative technologies in modern history. A wildly profitable technology, too. Once all the video went digital, and once all the digital video threw in an \"access control\" that blocked recording, it became a crime to record digital cable, satellite, or streaming, unless you used the service\\'s own PVR, which won\\'t let you tape some shows, or skip ads, and which deletes your stored shows when the broadcaster decides you don\\'t deserve to have them anymore.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s not illegal to record a video stream, no more than it was illegal to record a TV show off your analog cable or broadcast receiver. The same fair dealing exemptions apply. But because it\\'s illegal to bypass an access control, and the access control blocks recording, we uninvented the VCR. We made the VCR illegal. Not because Parliament ever passed a law banning VCRs, but because our anti-circumvention law allows dominant corporations to simply decide that certain conduct that they disprefer should no longer occur.</p>\\n<p>With Bill C-11, we\\'ve created \"felony contempt of business model.\" In living memory, video recording changed the world and made billions of dollars. Today, we\\'ve all lost our video recorders. But we have more reason than ever to want a video recorder; to pay for a video recorder. There\\'s fantastic amounts of money just sitting there on the table, money we\\'ve prohibited our entrepreneurs from making, in order to prevent the US from hitting us with the tariffs that they\\'ve just hit us with.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s be clear here: no one has the right to a profit. If you\\'ve got a business that sucks, and I make it not suck anymore, and your customers start paying me instead of you, well, that sounds like a you problem to me. I mean, does the Canadian government really want to decide which desirable products can and can\\'t exist?</p>\\n<p>Look, I\\'ve mainlined Tommy Douglas since I was in red diapers, but that sounds pretty commie, even to me.</p>\\n<p>Which brings me to Canada\\'s own sclerotic, monopoly-heavy commercial environment. After all, Canada is two monopolists and a mining company in a trenchcoat. Which is not to say that our oligarchs are weak. They love to throw their weight around. I guess owning an entire maritime province can go to your head.</p>\\n<p>Will any of these guys step up to cape for America\\'s tech giants? Do any of them benefit from our voluntary decision to let America walk all over us? Not really. But a little, at the margins. Guys like Ted Rogers make a lot of money by making us rent set-top boxes for our cable, which lock out recorders. Re-invent the VCR and Ted Rogers might have to sell his ivory-handled back-scratcher collection.</p>\\n<p>But let him squawk! He can afford the loss, and lest we forget, Ted Rogers made his second fortune renting us video cassettes to stick in our VCRs. When he did it, it was progress. If we do it to him, that\\'s not piracy.</p>\\n<p>Man, there is so much money to be made by becoming the disenshittification nation. It\\'s not just payments or video recorders. One of the main uses of access controls is blocking generic consumables, like inkjet ink. Parliament never made a law saying that people who buy a printer from HP have to buy their ink from HP, too. But because we made it illegal to bypass an access control, and because HP uses access controls to block generic ink, it\\'s a felony to use cheap ink in your own printer.</p>\\n<p>The cartel of four giant inkjet companies know they have us trapped, and they have monotonically raised and raised and raised the price of ink, so that today, printer ink is the most expensive fluid a civilian can purchase without a government permit. At $10,000 per gallon, it would be cheaper to print your grocery lists with the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion.</p>\\n<p>Some smart Canadian technologists could buy every make and model of every printer, and prepare a library of jailbreaks that works across every one, and keep it up to date with every new software update as soon as it\\'s pushed. Everyone in the world who wants to refill ink cartridges or manufacture generics could pay that company $25/month for access to the jailbreaking library and for support if a customer ran into a problem.</p>\\n<p>Every manic entrepreneur running a corner store with a Bitcoin ATM, knife-sharpening and Amazon parcel dropoff could add inkjet ink to their line of business. Multiply every guy with a folding table at a dry-cleaner who\\'ll fix your phone or jailbreak your printer by $25/month, by 12 months/year, and you\\'ve got tens or hundreds of millions flowing into this country.</p>\\n<p>We would transform HP\\'s billions into our millions, and the rest would be shared among the world\\'s printer owners as a consumer surplus and freedom from a scummy rent-seeking racket.</p>\\n<p>There\\'s more!</p>\\n<p>Every mechanic is paying $10,000 per manufacturer per year for the diagnostic tool that decrypts the messages on your car\\'s CAN bus and turns your \"check engine\" light into an actual error, and you\\'d better bet your mechanic is passing that cost onto you. Canadian car hackers can buy every make and model of every car as it comes off the line, jailbreak it, and keep it jailbroken with every new over-the-air update, and sell every mechanic in the world a $50/month subscription to a bang up to date diagnostic tool.</p>\\n<p>The mechanic wins. The drivers win. Canada wins. The Big Three automakers eat dirt, which is fine. Looks like we\\'re buying Chinese cars from now on, anyway, and Parliament never passed a law guaranteeing perpetual profitability to legacy automakers whose most innovative ideas consist of finding ways to rent you the accelerator pedal in your car, and new markets to sell the driving data they steal from you.</p>\\n<p>All kinds of devices can\\'t be fixed because of our anti-circumvention law, Bill C-11. You\\'ve probably heard about the problems farmers have fixing their John Deere tractors. Farmers actually do the repairs on those tractors, installing the parts themselves, but the tractor\\'s main computer will not activate those parts until the farmer pays a couple hundred bucks for a callout by a John Deere rep, who enters an unlock code that tells the tractor that John Deere got paid for this repair.</p>\\n<p>Farmers have been fixing their implements since prehistory. Since the invention of the plow.</p>\\n<p>Beamish is Europe\\'s largest open-air museum, just outside of Newcastle. Here we\\'d call it a \"pioneer village.\" They\\'ve rescued and relocated a whole Victorian village high street, an Edwardian colliery and workers\\' cottages, vehicles from all eras of British history, and they\\'ve got a farmhouse that sits on a Roman foundation.</p>\\n<p>That farmhouse has a forge. Because of course it does. Farmers have to be able to fix their stuff, because when the storm is coming, and you need to get the crops in, you can\\'t wait for a service technician to find their way to the end of your lonely country road.</p>\\n<p>But John Deere has declared an end of history, and our Copyright Modernization Act let them do it. Farmers can\\'t fix their tractors anymore, not because Parliament ever passed the \"No Fixing Your Tractor Act.\" They didn\\'t need to. They just passed an act that banned circumvention of access controls, which lets John Deere \u2013 and other rapacious American monopolists \u2013 conjure new felonies out of thin air. There\\'s that \"felony contempt of business model\" again.</p>\\n<p>At this point you might be thinking, \"Hold on a sec, didn\\'t Trudeau whip his caucus to get a Right to Repair bill through Parliament in 2024?\" You\\'re right, he did: Bill C-244. It lets anyone fix anything\u2026unless they have to bypass an access control in order to make the repair, in which case Bill C-11 makes that repair illegal. Canada\\'s got a Right to Repair law that\\'s big, bold, ambitious\u2026and useless, a mere ornament, thanks to our anti-circumvention law, which we passed because the US promised us tariff-free access to US markets, a promise that the US has broken, and that we should never believe again.</p>\\n<p>Everything we\\'ve tried to do to make Canada safe for US tech exports has failed. They\\'ve failed because they\\'re redistributive. We told them they could keep stealing money from our news companies so long as they gave some of it back. We told them they could keep stealing money from people who need to fix their property so long as they follow some rules. We told them they could keep stealing money from our market participants so long as they mixed some cancon in with their streaming libraries. Even our privacy laws are redistributive: sure, go on stealing Canadians\\' data, just promise to limit the ways you abuse it to a short list of permissible human rights violations.</p>\\n<p>You know what\\'s better than redistribution? Predistribution. Rather than bargaining to recoup some of the value being stripmined from us, we can intervene technologically to prevent the theft in the first place: jailbreak our devices, abolish the app tax, block their monopoly ad insertions and replace them with open ad markets based on content, not surveillance, give users control over the media in their streaming libraries. Let Canadian businesses disenshittify our phones, TVs, tractors, cars and ventilators so anyone can fix them.</p>\\n<p>Ask any economist and they\\'ll tell you that the very best strategy is to have an open, fair system in the first place. Rather than tolerating and even enshrining unfairness in the system, and then begging the beneficiaries of that unfairness to dribble a few crumbs to the hungry victims at their feet.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps all of this is unconvincing to you. Maybe you\\'re not interested in our digital rights. Maybe you\\'re not excited by the prospect of turning America\\'s trillions into Canada\\'s billions. Well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve got something for you, too: national security.</p>\\n<p>Trump has made it clear that America no longer has allies or trading partners, it only has rivals and adversaries. He\\'s also made it clear that he cannot be mollified. Any concessions we make to him will be treated as a sign of weakness, and an invitation to demand more. Give him an inch, he\\'ll take a kilometer.</p>\\n<p>Give him an inch, he\\'ll take Greenland.</p>\\n<p>This is undeniably scary, because Trump has lots of non-kinetic options for pursuing his geopolitical aims. First among them is attacking his adversaries through his tech companies. He\\'s already started tinkering with this. When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the genocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump went through the roof, and Microsoft obliged him by shutting down the court\\'s access to its documents, emails, calendars and address books. They bricked the court.</p>\\n<p>Now, I should say here that Microsoft denies that they shut down the court to please Trump. They say it\\'s a coincidence. But when it comes to a \"he-said/Clippy-said\" dispute between the human rights defenders at the ICC and the convicted monopolists at Microsoft, I know who I believe. What\\'s more, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he \"couldn\\'t guarantee\" that Microsoft wouldn\\'t hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-centre. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there\\'d be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it\\'s happening right now.</p>\\n<p>Trump has demonstrated that he will both bully and bribe US companies into doing his bidding. Cross him and he\\'ll put extra tariffs on the inputs you need to import from abroad, he\\'ll take away your key workers\\' visas and deport them, he\\'ll smack you with pretextual antitrust investigations, and sue you in his personal capacity.</p>\\n<p>But if you capitulate to him, he\\'ll give you no-bid government contracts, and hand you billions to provide surveillance gear and prison camps to help with his programme of ethnic cleansing. The tech companies are up to their eyeballs in Trump\\'s authoritarian takeover of the US. There\\'s no daylight between Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other US tech companies and the Trump regime.</p>\\n<p>You can be certain that if \u2013 when! \u2013 Trump orders these companies to shut down a government ministry (perhaps your ministry) or a corporation (perhaps your corporation) that they will do so.</p>\\n<p>Everyone in the world is waking up to this. In the EU, they\\'ve just created a new \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar, and they\\'re busily funding the \"Eurostack,\" a set of open, auditable replacements for US tech silos that can run on EU-based data-centres.</p>\\n<p>But they\\'re about to hit a wall. Because it doesn\\'t matter how great those Eurostack services are. If you can\\'t scrape, virtualize and jailbreak US Big Tech apps, so that you can exfiltrate your data, logs, file histories and permissions, no government ministry or large company can do that work by hand. It will challenge many households, who have entrusted US tech\\'s walled gardens with their financial data, family photos, groupchats, family calendars, and other structures that are not easily ported without cooperation from the tech giants. They are not going to cooperate with a mass exodus from their services. They will do everything they can to impede it.</p>\\n<p>Building the Eurostack without legalizing circumvention is like building housing for East Germans in West Berlin. It doesn\\'t matter how cool those apartments are, they\\'re gonna sit empty until you tear down the wall.</p>\\n<p>And administrative software is just for openers. Remember back in 2022, when Putin\\'s thugs looted millions of dollars\\' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine? These are permanently connected to John Deere\\'s cloud, which is how the John Deere company was able to trace them to Chechnya, and how they were able to send an over-the-air kill signal to the tractor that permanently bricked them.</p>\\n<p>And yes, I\\'ll freely admit that as a cyberpunk writer, this gives a little frisson of satisfaction. But if you only think about it for 10 seconds, you\\'ll realize that this means that Deere can immobilize any tractor in the world, or pretty much every tractor in Canada (and the rest of our tractors are likely from Massey Ferguson, another US giant also in thrall to Trump that can brick its tractors over the air, too).</p>\\n<p>This is exactly the threat we were warned of if we let Huawei supply our 5G infrastructure. Remember that? That whole \"Two Michaels\" business that we got stuck in when we let the US convince us that Huawei was gonna install landmines in our technological infrastructure? Well, you know how the saying goes: \"Every accusation is a confession.\"</p>\\n<p>But of course, China could brick the Chinese cloud-connected tech in Canada, like our solar inverters and batteries. The good news is that whether you\\'re a US natsec hawk or a China natsec hawk, you have the same path out of this trap. Namely: repealing Bill C-11, and legalizing circumvention so that we can deke out the locked bootloaders on our infrastructure and install open, auditable, transparent firmware on them. Because that is an infinitely more reliable way to render your systems into a known-good state than arresting random executives from giant Chinese companies.</p>\\n<p>And the good news is, everyone else in the world wants this, too, because they\\'re all facing the same risks as we are. So this isn\\'t really a technological project, in the sense of having a bunch of duelling firms all competing to come up with their own proprietary answer to an engineering problem. It\\'s more like a scientific project, in that we should have a commons, a git server filled with auditable, transparent, trustworthy drop-in code for whole classes of devices, from cars to TVs to smart speakers to ventilators to tractors to phone switches, that everyone contributes to and peer reviews.</p>\\n<p>We wouldn\\'t tolerate secrecy in our science. No one gets to keep the math used to calculate the load stresses on the joists holding the roof over our head a secret. We wouldn\\'t tolerate secrecy in the characteristics of the alloys in those joists, or even the wires carrying electricity through the walls. We should not tolerate secrecy in how our digital infrastructure works, either.</p>\\n<p>After all, a modern building is just a fancy casemod for a bunch of computers. Take all the computers out of a hospital and it becomes a morgue. There\\'s no secret medical science, and there should be no secret medical code, either.</p>\\n<p>So this is it. This is how we win. Trump has unwittingly recruited three armies to fight to end the enshittocene, the era in which all of our technology has turned to shit. There\\'s the digital rights hippies like me (who\\'ve been banging this drum since the 2000s); and then there\\'s the entrepreneurs and investors (eager for a chance to turn America\\'s tech trillions into Canada\\'s tech billions, making Canada into a global tech export powerhouse); and finally, there\\'s the national security hawks (who correctly worry that we are at risk of a kind of cyberwarfare the world has never seen before).</p>\\n<p>Normally, cyberwarfare involves hackers associated with an adversary state breaking into your critical systems, but Microsoft doesn\\'t have to break into your ministry\\'s Office365 and Outlook accounts to spy on you or brick your agencies. They already have root on your servers. For Trump, this is cyberwarfare on the easiest setting imaginable.</p>\\n<p>I started throwing this idea around right after Trump announced his first round of tariffs. There was this Canadian think-tank that was soliciting suggestions for Canadian countermeasures, and I sent them this stuff, and they said, \"Well, that would definitely work, but it\\'ll make Trump really mad at us.\"</p>\\n<p>Which, you know, true. But anything that works will make Trump mad at us. So again, I must fall back on my Canadian heritage here and apologize.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m sorry that I don\\'t have any empty gestures for us to deploy, only ideas for things that will work.</p>\\n<p>I mean, we can stick with the current plan, our retaliatory tariffs, which make everything we buy from America more expensive, and make us all poorer. That\\'ll do something. Like, it\\'ll certainly impose broad-spectrum pain on a bunch of American producers. If we decide to stop drinking delicious bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky\\'s undrinkable rye, there\\'s gonna be some corn farmer out there in a state that begins and ends with a vowel who\\'ll have trouble making payments on his John Deere tractor. But what did that farmer ever do to us?</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if we go into business selling everyone in the world (including that farmer) (including our own farmer) reliable, auditable, regulated, transparent drop-in firmware replacement for that tractor, then we free that farmer from the rent-extracting scams that John Deere uses to drain his bank account. And since we remain that guy\\'s customer, maybe he\\'ll side with us against Trump, along with the hundreds of millions of American technology users who we can also set free from the app tax, from commercial surveillance that feeds authoritarian state surveillance, from the repair ripoffs, from ink that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion. They become our champions, too.</p>\\n<p>Because if we legalize jailbreaking, we will limit the blast radius of our counterattack, to the tech barons who each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais and their shareholders, who are not everyday Americans. Everyday Americans have gotten poorer every year for 50 years, thanks to wage stagnation, wage theft, economic bubbles and skyrocketing health, education and housing costs.</p>\\n<p>They\\'ll tell you that most Americans own stock, but the amount of stock the average American holds rounds to zero. Nearly all US stock is held by the richest 10% of Americans \u2013 the ones who are backing Trump and getting rich off Trump \u2013 and legalizing jailbreaking is a targeted strike on just those people, which will only benefit our American cousins, the everyday people who\\'ve been abused for generations by these eminently guillotineable plutocrats.</p>\\n<p>Canada is in a good position to do this. We\\'ve got motive, means and opportunity, but we\\'re not the only ones. Most of the countries in the world are situated to take advantage of this opportunity, to become the \"disenshittification nation\" that supplies the world with wildly profitable software tools that fix America\\'s defective technology.</p>\\n<p>All it takes is one country defecting. That country gets to reap the benefit \u2013 the billions \u2013 of exporting those tools to the world, while the rest of us only get to enjoy the consumer surplus, the technology that works better and costs us less money and privacy to use.</p>\\n<p>You know how Ireland defected from the world\\'s tax treaties and, through regulatory arbitrage, made billions luring the world\\'s largest companies to establish domicile in Dublin, while depriving the world\\'s tax collectors of trillions? Regulatory arbitrage is the game everyone can play. When a country decides to become the Ireland for disenshittification, the nation where it\\'s legal to jailbreak locked technology, and export the tools to do so to everyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method, they will get to reap the largest benefit. They\\'ll grab the hoarded monopoly rents of America\\'s tech giants and use them as fuel for a single-use rocket that launches their domestic tech sector into a stable orbit for generations.</p>\\n<p>Those American tech companies need to be relieved of the dead capital on their balance sheets. What are these companies doing with their looted trillions? Blowing it all on AI. They tell you there\\'s a lot of money to be made with AI, but no one can tell you where it\\'s going to come from.</p>\\n<p>This month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he\\'s going to recoup the hundreds of billions of dollars he\\'s pissed away on AI by turning Google into the world\\'s perfect engine for surveillance pricing. That\\'s when a company uses surveillance data to predict how desperate you are, and jacks up the price to the highest amount they think they can get you to part with.</p>\\n<p>This is a terrible idea of course, but it\\'s not just terrible in the sense of \"this is an idea Google should be ashamed of.\" It\\'s terrible in the sense of \"this won\\'t work because everyone will hate it and refuse to participate in it.\" It\\'s just another harebrained scheme to finally find a way to make AI profitable, or at least less unprofitable.</p>\\n<p>Compare that with my anti-circumvention plan. I can tell you exactly where the money in my plan is going to come from: it\\'s just sitting there on Big Tech\\'s balance sheets, waiting for us to go get it. We\\'ll make money by making products that people want, because it will make their tech better, and they will pay us for them.</p>\\n<p>I mean, I know that sounds old-fashioned. But what can I say? Sometimes, the old ways are best.</p>\\n<p>If there\\'s one thing Canada is good at, it\\'s going to other countries and digging up all their wealth. America\\'s tech giants have buried trillions of dollars they stole from the world, and we know exactly where it is. What\\'s more, we can dig it out from here.

Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, The Hospital at the End of the World:</p>\\n<p>https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve followed Key\\'s work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers\\' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me \u2013 a standout writer in a year full of standouts \u2013 and I wasn\\'t surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, The World Wasn\\'t Ready For You, in 2023:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015</p>\\n<p>This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don\\'t publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven\\'t already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they\\'re names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll</p>\\n<p>But anyone who read World Wasn\\'t Ready immediately understood why Key\\'s work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops.</p>\\n<p>Hospital at the End of the World is Key\\'s first novel, and it\\'s terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, Hospital follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok\\'s father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings.</p>\\n<p>The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from every medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That\\'s when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father.</p>\\n<p>To make things worse, Pok\\'s father has fallen grievously ill \u2013 so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn\\'t accompany his father, though \u2013 he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok\\'s apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization.</p>\\n<p>Thus begins Pok\\'s tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America\\'s AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok\\'s father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization\\'s rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine.</p>\\n<p>Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people.</p>\\n<p>This is the book\\'s second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth.</p>\\n<p>What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key\\'s own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It\\'s one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care.

To prove it, you need only pick up The Universe Box, Swanwick\\'s just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field\\'s greatest writers at the absolute pinnacle of his game:</p>\\n<p>https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/</p>\\n<p>Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is  a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, multiple sf magazines that publish short stories every month, on paper, and pay for it. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s a pretty common trajectory in sf, where \u2013 notwithstanding the field\\'s status as a haven for the short story \u2013 the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can\\'t assume anything about the story\\'s setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies.</p>\\n<p>All of that has to be established in the story. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There\\'s a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don\\'t tell\"). It\\'s fairer to say that exposition is hard \u2013 dramatization is, well, dramatic, which makes it easier to engage the reader\\'s attention. But great exposition is great and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well:</p>\\n<p>https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/</p>\\n<p>The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\":</p>\\n<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html</p>\\n<p>Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the reader work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you\\'ve been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that\\'s not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded.</p>\\n<p>This is a terrific experience, but it is also work. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the story part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires \u2013 and rewards \u2013 very active attention.</p>\\n<p>(Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain\\'s classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":)</p>\\n<p>https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. None of this applies to Swanwick. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there\\'s never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It\\'s not merely that he\\'s a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last.</p>\\n<p>Somehow, though, he just slides these stories into your brain.</p>\\n<p>And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise beginnings (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else).</p>\\n<p>This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.</p>\\n<p>This is a book of worlds that each exist for just a handful of pages but occupy more space than those pages could possibly contain. It\\'s a series of cigar boxes, each with the universe inside of it.</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>U.S. Envoys Refused to Report \"Apocalyptic\" Conditions in Gaza.

But when you\\'re thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn\\'t just a nation of cruel bigots; it\\'s also a nation of rich swindlers.</p>\\n<p>We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it\\'s true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man\\'s idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments \u2013 local, state and federal.</p>\\n<p>He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\":</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth</p>\\n<p>Like so many crooked officials, Trump\\'s brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn\\'t \u2013 at any given moment, odds are that he\\'s either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf):</p>\\n<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/</p>\\n<p>Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump has to convince people that they can\\'t rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he \u2013 as a man who is an expert at cheating \u2013 knows how to rig it in your favor:</p>\\n<p>https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/</p>\\n<p>But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn\\'t actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is actually rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts:</p>\\n<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/</p>\\n<p>Want to convince people that there\\'s a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there\\'s an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans\\' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\\'s advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans\\' houses:</p>\\n<p>https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/</p>\\n<p>Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren\\'t enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated</p>\\n<p>This is why it\\'s worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you\\'re being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it\\'s all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf.</p>\\n<p>Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they\\'re valuable and desirable:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs</p>\\n<p>Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but scientific, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us.</p>\\n<p>In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes up while its value goes down.</p>\\n<p>I mean that literally: say a company that\\'s sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company\\'s capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That\\'s a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it\\'s worth one billion dollars.</p>\\n<p>Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, the drop in corporate valuation is more than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company\\'s worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop more than a billion dollars off the company\\'s share price. Instead, it sends the share price up.</p>\\n<p>This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name \u2013 just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits.</p>\\n<p>This is categorically untrue. Dividends do take money out of the company\\'s coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure \u2013 but a dividend is a bet on the company\\'s future success, which is why a company\\'s share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company\\'s stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations.</p>\\n<p>But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn\\'t afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year\\'s blockbuster book.</p>\\n<p>That dividend would not send investors chasing the company\\'s stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won\\'t have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets.</p>\\n<p>Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up.</p>\\n<p>In other words: when a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a dividend, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s management and its future growth. When a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a buyback, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s future looting to the point of collapse.</p>\\n<p>I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I\\'ve been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff\\'s book The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, and I\\'ve learned even more scummy truths about buybacks:</p>\\n<p>https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html</p>\\n<p>For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay half the tax on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital losses. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you\\'ve made.</p>\\n<p>But you don\\'t even have to sell the stock to realize tax-free income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid all taxes.</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s how that works: if you\\'re sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you\\'re smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is tax-deductible. If you\\'re rich enough, you don\\'t have to make regular payments on the loan, either \u2013 you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it\\'s due, you borrow even more money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here\\'s \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid all capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets.</p>\\n<p>Now, maybe you\\'re thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I\\'ve got bad news for you: you won\\'t qualify for one of those cool loans that you don\\'t need to pay regularly! What\\'s more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), that is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay.</p>\\n<p>Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get much richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don\\'t benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can\\'t spend when rich people don\\'t pay taxes.</p>\\n<p>This is why buybacks have apologists. Buybacks \u2013 a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory \u2013 make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people:</p>\\n<p>https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/</p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises:</p>\\n<p>https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/</p>\\n<p>The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" \u2013 literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway\\'s founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</p>\\n<p>Trump\\'s right: the system is rigged. If you\\'re going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can\\'t insist \u2013 as Hillary Clinton did \u2013 that \"America is already great\":</p>\\n<p>https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078</p>\\n<p>America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it\\'s not enough to know that the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know how it is rigged and who rigged it.</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Wherein I have some thoughts on food delivery apps https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2026/02/01.html\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A Letter On Justice And Open Debate About Raping Children https://www.popehat.com/p/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate-about-raping-children</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Impeach President Miller https://prospect.org/2026/01/31/impeach-president-miller/</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Google Settlement May Bring New Privacy Controls for Real-Time Bidding https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/google-settlement-may-bring-new-privacy-controls-real-time-bidding</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s since Trump took office https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>#25yrsago Acme License-Plate Maker https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?state=California&amp;amp;text=NSHITKN&amp;amp;plate=1987&amp;amp;r=943099606</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Apple implements iStore changes, prohibits Sony from selling competing ebook app https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html?_r=3</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago IPv4 is exhausted https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/02/01/0036227/Last-Available-IPv4-Blocks-Allocated</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Harper\u2019s publisher rejects $50K worth of pledges, will lay off staff anyway https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDoZvxCvsax1zkMKANucBCQU8v-08tcw6VIDrtnmnqLY9I0A/viewform?formkey=dGdtbXUtNUV3cmtpaXJienJ5bldwcUE6MQ</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago South Dakota senator introduces mandatory gun-ownership law https://www.newser.com/story/111031/south-dakota-bill-every-adult-must-own-a-gun.html</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago UK Snooper\u2019s Charter is so broad, no one can figure out what it means https://web.archive.org/web/20160202092111/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/tech-firms-are-unclear-on-new-uk-surveillance-laws-warns-government-committee</p>\\n<p>#5yrsago The good news about vaccination bad news https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#mixed-news</p>\\n<p>#5yrsago Unidirectional entryism https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Inside Sukey the anti-kettling mobile app https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/02/inside-anti-kettling-hq</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Swatting attempted against Congresswoman who introduced anti-swatting bill https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago A would-be clinic-bomber &amp;

Back in 2022, two teenagers unilaterally disenshittified Instagram by making an \"alt-client\" that restored all the parts of Insta that made it a success and blocked all the antifeatures that Meta crammed down users\\' throats after they had them locked in.</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s how OG App worked: first, it popped up a browser window and loaded the Instagram login screen. Then, after you\\'d logged into Insta, it stole the \"session key\" (the cryptographic proof that you were logged into your account). That let it impersonate you to Insta\\'s servers, and slurp down the whole feed that Insta had queued up for you.</p>\\n<p>After grabbing your feed, OG App deleted all the ads, all the slop, all the boosted content, all the months-old clickbait that The Algorithm (TM) had surfaced. What was left was pristine: the posts from people you followed, in reverse-chronological order. To make this all even sweeter, OG App sent no data back to Meta as you used it, except for the likes and comments you intended to transmit to the company. All the other data that Meta\\'s apps gather got blocked: everything from your location, to which posts you slowed down your scrolling on, to accelerometer readouts that revealed minute changes in how you hold your phone from second to second.</p>\\n<p>Boy did people like this! By the end of the day, OG App was in the top ten charts for both Google and Apple\\'s app stores. By the next morning, it was gone. Meta sent a takedown notice to the app store duopoly and they killed OG App on its behalf (there is honor among thieves):</p>\\n<p>https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/</p>\\n<p>The funny thing is, the OG App creators were just following the Facebook playbook. When Facebook opened up to the general public in 2006, it had the problem that everyone who wanted social media already had an account on Myspace, and all of Facebook\\'s improvements on Myspace (Zuck made a promise never to spy on his users!) didn\\'t matter, because Myspace had something Facebook could not match: Myspace had all your friends.</p>\\n<p>Facebook came up with an ingenious solution to this problem: they offered Myspace users a bot. You gave that bot your Myspace login credentials (just as OG App did with your Insta credentials) and the bot impersonated you to Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and it grabbed everything queued up for you on Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and then flowed those messages into your Facebook feed (just as OG App did with Insta).</p>\\n<p>This was very successful! Users didn\\'t have to choose between their friends on Myspace and the superior design and privacy policies of Facebook. They got to eat their cake and have it, too.</p>\\n<p>This is actually a very old and important pattern in tech. It\\'s what \"move fast and break things\" looks like when it\\'s actually disrupting sclerotic and decaying companies that lock us in, take us for granted, and treat us like shit. It\\'s what Apple did when they cloned the MS Office file formats and released iWork, whose Pages, Numbers and Keynote let Microsoft users escape from the prison of Windows and bring their documents with them:</p>\\n<p>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay</p>\\n<p>But like every pirate, the tech companies dreamed of being admirals. Once they\\'d attained the admiralty, they announced that when they did this stuff, it was progress, but if anyone does it to them, it would be piracy.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, they were able to take advantage of a metastasizing blob of IP laws that the US Trade Representative spread around the world (with threats of tariffs for noncompliance). Soon, nearly every country had enacted laws that made it a literal crime for their entrepreneurs and technologists to fix America\\'s defective tech exports by adding privacy tools, bridging old services into new ones, or reading and writing America\\'s ubiquitous proprietary file-formats:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</p>\\n<p>For decades, this system was immovable. The world couldn\\'t afford tariffs on its exports to the USA, and it was able to maintain the pretense that America\\'s platforms were trustworthy neutral parties, that would not be weaponized against their own national interest at the behest of the American state.</p>\\n<p>Obviously, that is dead now. Donald Trump, debilitated by white matter disease and his endemic incontinent belligerence, has flipped the table over in a poker game that was rigged in his favor because he resented having to pretend to play (TM November Kelly):</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar</p>\\n<p>EU member-states are minting new \"digital sovereignty\" ministries as fast as they can print up new business cards, the EU itself has just appointed its first \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar:</p>\\n<p>https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen_en</p>\\n<p>They\\'re building the \"Eurostack,\" a fleet of EU-based data centers that will host free, open, auditable, trustworthy equivalents to the US tech giants\\' offerings:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/25/eurostack/#viktor-orbans-isp</p>\\n<p>But Eurostack is about to run into a wall: Article 6 of the EU\\'s own Copyright Directive, which prohibits reverse-engineering and modification of tech products. It\\'s a law that the US Trade Rep lobbied hard for, winning the day by promising tariff-free access to the US for Europe\\'s exports (a promise Trump has now broken):</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate</p>\\n<p>So long as Europe continues to hold up its end of this one-sided bargain, it will not be able to create the reverse-engineering based tools to let EU companies, governments and households get their data out of US tech silos, let alone let them build and enjoy successors to OG App, which will make it easy for them to leave US social media without sacrificing contact with the people who matter to them.</p>\\n<p>Which brings me to Threads, Meta\\'s latest social media network. Threads is built on Activitypub and Mastodon, these being open/free, auditable and trustworthy protocols, designed to support \"federated\" social media. That\\'s social media that runs on servers managed by lots of different entities, whose users can all connect to one another no matter which server they use. Meta was clearly excited by the prospect of enclosing and conquering this open upstart, but also nervous at the prospect that its users would find, in federation, an easy path to escape from Meta\\'s clutches.</p>\\n<p>After all, if you can leave Threads and join a non-Meta Mastodon server without losing contact with the people you followed and were followed by on Threads, then why wouldn\\'t you leave? Mark Zuckerberg\\'s users don\\'t like him \u2013 they just hate him less than they love the people they are in community with on Zuckerberg\\'s platforms.</p>\\n<p>So Threads never really joined the Fediverse. You can\\'t quite follow and be followed by Mastodon users, and you can\\'t quite migrate your account off Meta\\'s servers and onto a better one. Zuck and his lieutenants are keenly attuned to any design that drives high \"switching costs\" for leaving their services, and they exploit these switching costs to figure out just how much pain they can inflict on users without risking their departure:</p>\\n<p>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs</p>\\n<p>So now they\\'ve started to turn the screws on Threads users. They just announced a global program of Threads enshittification, with a promise to cram ads into the eyeballs of every Threads account:</p>\\n<p>https://www.contentgrip.com/meta-threads-ads-go-global/</p>\\n<p>This represents a hell of an opportunity for the EU and Eurostack. Meta\\'s ads are wildly illegal in the EU, violating Europe\\'s landmark privacy law, the GDPR. The only reason Meta gets away with its flagrant lawbreaking is that it has captured the Irish state, and uses legal tricks to force all GDPR enforcement into Irish jurisdiction:</p>\\n<p>https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</p>\\n<p>People hate ads. More than half of all web users have installed an adblocker (which also protects their privacy). It\\'s the largest consumer boycott in human history:</p>\\n<p>https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/</p>\\n<p>But no one has ever installed an adblocker for an app, because reverse-engineering apps and the mobile platforms they run on is illegal under laws like Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. As a result, tech companies \u2013 especially US giants, who can violate EU law with impunity \u2013 love to enshittify their apps, because they know that no one can do unto them as they did unto their own rivals (like Myspace).</p>\\n<p>Meta\\'s new ad strategy for Threads is the perfect cue for a European repeal of Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. Procedurally, this is a great moment for it, as the EU is finalizing the Digital Fairness Act, which could include an exemption to EUCD 6 for privacy-enhancing technologies:</p>\\n<p>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-protecting-our-democracy-upholding-our-values/file-digital-fairness-act</p>\\n<p>Giving Europeans an effective way to push back against Meta\\'s wholesale violation of their rights is a way that the Eurostack can score popular support right now \u2013 not in five years when the new data centers come online. It\\'s a way of improving the lives of Europeans in immediate, concrete ways, rather than asking them to be grateful that some ministry has changed cloud providers \u2013 an important change, sure, but one that has no real impact on their daily lives.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, legalizing jailbreaking for the purpose of making Threads alt-clients wouldn\\'t just give Europeans a better social media experience \u2013 it could bootstrap European social media services. Remember, Threads was able to achieve instant scale by moving Instagram users onto Threads wholesale, maintaining their Insta follows and followers when they created their Threads accounts.</p>\\n<p>Europe \u2013 like everywhere else \u2013 is full of entrepreneurs who are trying to get national, independent social media platforms off the ground, hoping to woo users by promising them a more privacy-respecting alternative. They\\'ve got the same problem Zuck had when he tried to compete with Myspace: users love their friends more than they hate being spied on, so merely offering a better service is insufficient.</p>\\n<p>To get users off the old platforms, you have to lower their switching costs \u2013 you have to let them bring their friends to the new network, even if those friends are still stuck on the old network. Legalize jailbreaking in the EU and you\\'ll make it possible to do \"on-device bridging\" \u2013 where a new social media app is able to break open the data storage of the Threads app on the same device and move that data into its own feeds. And because the EU has the GDPR, they have the privacy framework needed to police the privacy violations that breaking into other apps\\' data storage can lead to.</p>\\n<p>Meta will squawk. They\\'ll say Europe is legalizing the violation of its corporate rights. But Meta violates Europeans\\' rights at scale, and the \"rights\" that I\\'m talking about taking away from Meta are rights the EU gave it in the first place, in exchange for a broken promise of tariff-free access to the USA.</p>\\n<p>Adblocking isn\\'t stealing. Adblocking is bargaining. Without adblocking, the companies don\\'t sell us services in exchange for our privacy \u2013 they plunder all the private data they can get, and dribble out services at whatever level they think we deserve. If ad-supported media was a restaurant, it\\'d be one where you got thrown up against a wall, relieved of your wallet, fed a handful of gruel, and then got kicked in the ass and sent on your way:</p>\\n<p>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah</p>\\n<p>Every time Donald Trump threatens the EU, he makes the case for the Eurostack, but still, he can\\'t help himself. Likewise, every time Zuckerberg enshittifies his services, he makes the case for repealing Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and he can\\'t help himself either.</p>\\n<p>Threads\\' inexorable enshittification is an opportunity: an opportunity to make the case for the Eurostack, an opportunity to improve the lives of millions of Europeans, and an opportunity to break through the walled gardens that keep the people we love stuck on legacy social media platforms.</p>\\n<p>When they did it to us, that wasn\\'t progress. When we do it to them, it\\'s not piracy.</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>EFF to Close Friday in Solidarity with National Shutdown  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/eff-close-friday-solidarity-national-shutdown\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Let\\'s Make Hope Normal Again https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxt4HCjd7VA</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Detecting Dementia Using Lexical Analysis: Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld Tells a More Personal Story  https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/16/1/94</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>How is Inventing the Renaissance an SFF-Related Work? https://www.exurbe.com/how-is-inventing-the-renaissance-an-sff-related-work/</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The Good, the Pretty, and Fear Itself https://catvalente.substack.com/p/the-good-the-pretty-and-fear-itself</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>#25yrsago Frank Chu explainer http://www.12galaxies.20m.com</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago Kerouac curator invents copyright laws to keep photographers away https://thomashawk.com/2006/01/open-letter-to-myra-borshoff-cook-tour.html</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago EFF suing AT&amp;T for helping NSA illegally spy on Americans https://www.eff.org/cases/nsa-multi-district-litigation</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago CD DRM software players are amateurish and easy to trick https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2006/01/31/cd-drm-attacks-player/</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago MPAA puts TSA goon in charge of enforcement https://web.archive.org/web/20060209035921/http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_01_31.pdf</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago US-VISIT immigration system spent $15 million per crook caught https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/the_failure_of_1.html</p>\\n<p>#20yrsago Law firm fires clerk for personal opposition to DRM https://web.archive.org/web/20060203030500/http://www.freeculturenyu.org/2006/01/31/drm-fired/</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Free excerpt from Jo Walton\u2019s brilliant Among Others https://web.archive.org/web/20110204214337/http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/01/excerpt-among-others</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Debunking yet another bought-and-paid-for report on the need for non-neutral net https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/01/huge-isps-want-per-gb-payments-from-netflix-youtube/</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Batman: billionaire plutocrat vigilante https://reactormag.com/batman-plutocrat/</p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Another copyright troll throws in the towel https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/01/31</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Ten hard truths about the Flint water atrocity https://www.ecowatch.com/michael-moore-10-things-they-wont-tell-you-about-the-flint-water-trage-1882162388.html</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Watch: AMAZING slam poem about policing women\u2019s speech habits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4_QwmaNoQ</p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Congress wants to know if agencies were compromised by the backdoor in Juniper gear (and where it came from) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-juniper-networks-congress-idUSKCN0V708P/</p>\\n<p>#5yrsago Know Nothings, conspiratorialism and Pastel Q https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/31/rhymes-with-pastel-q/#paranoid-style</p>\\n<p>#5yrsago Mashing the Bernie meme https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/31/rhymes-with-pastel-q/#bernie-3d</p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Salt Lake City: Enshittification at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (Tanner Humanities Center), Feb 18\\nhttps://tanner.utah.edu/center-events/cory-doctorow/\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Victoria: 28th Annual Victoria International Privacy &amp;

The die is 5mm\u00d76mm.  Click for a larger image. \\n The chip\\'s instructions are defined by the large microcode ROM in the middle.\\nTo execute a floating-point instruction, the 8087 decodes the instruction and the microcode engine starts executing\\nthe appropriate micro-instructions from the microcode ROM.\\nThe microcode decode circuitry to the right of the ROM generates the appropriate control signals from each micro-instruction. 1 \\nThe bus registers and control circuitry handle interactions with the main 8086 processor and the rest of the system. \\n The 8087\\'s microcode \\n Executing an 8087 instruction such as arctan requires hundreds of internal steps to compute the result.\\nThese steps are implemented in microcode with micro-instructions specifying each step of the algorithm.\\n(Keep in mind the difference between the assembly language instructions used by a programmer and the\\nundocumented low-level micro-instructions used internally by the chip.)\\nThe microcode ROM holds 1648 micro-instructions, implementing the 8087\\'s instruction set.\\nEach micro-instruction is 16 bits long and performs a simple operation such as moving data inside the chip, adding two values, or shifting data.\\nI\\'m working with the \"Opcode Collective\" to reverse engineer the micro-instructions and fully understand the microcode ( link ). \\n The microcode engine (below) controls the execution of micro-instructions, acting as the mini-CPU inside the 8087.\\nSpecifically, it generates an 11-bit micro-address, the address of a micro-instruction in the ROM.\\nThe microcode engine implements jumps, subroutine calls, and returns within the microcode.\\nThese jumps, subroutine calls, and returns are all conditional; the microcode engine will either perform the\\noperation or skip it, depending on the value of a specified condition. \\n The microcode engine. In this image, the metal is removed, showing the underlying silicon and polysilicon. \\n I\\'ll write more about the microcode engine later, but I\\'ll give an overview here.\\nAt the top, the Instruction Decode PLA 2 decodes an 8087 instruction to determine the starting address in\\nmicrocode.\\nBelow that, the Jump PLA holds microcode addresses for jumps and subroutine calls.\\nBelow this, six 11-bit registers implement the microcode stack, allowing six levels of subroutine calls inside the\\nmicrocode.\\n(Note that this stack is completely different from the 8087\\'s register stack that holds eight floating-point values.)\\nThe stack registers have associated read/write circuitry.\\nThe incrementer adds one to the micro-address to step through the code.\\nThe engine also implements relative jumps, using an adder to add an offset to the current location.\\nAt the bottom, the address latch and drivers boost the 11-bit address output\\nand send it to the microcode ROM. \\n Selecting a condition \\n A micro-instruction can say \"jump ahead 5 micro-instructions if a register is zero\" and the\\nmicrocode engine will either perform the jump or ignore it, based on the register value.\\nIn the circuitry, the condition causes the microcode engine to either perform the jump or block the jump.\\nBut how does the hardware select one condition out of the large set of conditions? \\n Six bits of the micro-instruction can specify one of 64 conditions.\\nA circuit similar to the idealized diagram below selects the specified condition.\\nThe key component is a multiplexer, represented by a trapezoid below.\\nA multiplexer is a simple circuit that selects one of its four inputs.\\nBy arranging multiplexers in a tree, one of the 64 conditions on the left is selected and becomes the output,\\npassed to the microcode engine. \\n A tree of multiplexers selects one of the conditions. This diagram is simplified. \\n For example, if bits J and K of the microcode are 00, the rightmost multiplexer will select the first input.\\nIf bits LM are 01, the middle multiplexer will select the second input, and if bits NO are 10, the left\\nmultiplexer will select its third input. The result is that condition 06 will pass through the tree and become the output. 3 \\nBy changing the bits that control the multiplexers, any of the inputs can be used.\\n(We\\'ve arbitrarily given the 16 microcode bits the letter names A through P.) \\n Physically, the conditions come from locations scattered across the die. For instance, conditions involving the opcode\\ncome from the instruction decoding part of the chip, while conditions involving a register are evaluated\\nnext to the register.\\nIt would be inefficient to run 64 wires for all the conditions to the microcode engine.\\nThe tree-based approach reduces the wiring since the \"leaf\" multiplexers can be located\\nnear the associated condition circuitry. Thus, only one wire needs to travel a long distance rather than multiple wires.\\nIn other words, the condition selection circuitry is distributed across the chip instead of being implemented as\\na centralized module. \\n Because the conditions don\\'t always fall into groups of four, the actual implementation is slightly different from\\nthe idealized diagram above.\\nIn particular, the top-level multiplexer has five inputs, rather than four. 4 \\nOther multiplexers don\\'t use all four inputs.\\nThis provides a better match between the physical locations of the condition circuits and the multiplexers.\\nIn total, 49 of the possible 64 conditions are implemented in the 8087. \\n The circuit that selects one of the four conditions is called a multiplexer.\\nIt is constructed from pass transistors, transistors that are configured to either pass a signal through\\nor block it.\\nTo operate the multiplexer, one of the select lines is energized, turning on the corresponding pass transistor.\\nThis allows the selected input to pass through the transistor to the output, while the other inputs are blocked. \\n A 4-1 multiplexer, constructed from four pass transistors. \\n The diagram below shows how a multiplexer appears on the die. The pinkish regions are doped silicon. The white\\nlines are polysilicon wires.\\nWhen polysilicon crosses over doped silicon, a transistor is formed.\\nOn the left is a four-way multiplexer, constructed from four pass transistors. It takes inputs (black) for four conditions,\\nnumbered 38, 39, 3a, and 3b.\\nThere are four control signals (red) corresponding to the four combinations of bits N and O.\\nOne of the inputs will pass through a transistor to the output, selected by the active control signal.\\nThe right half contains the logic (four NOR gates and two inverters) to generate the control signals from the\\nmicrocode bits.\\n(Metal lines run horizontally from the logic to the control signal contacts, but I dissolved the metal for this\\nphoto.)\\nEach multiplexer in the 8087 has a completely different layout,\\nmanually optimized based on the location of the signals and surrounding circuitry.\\nAlthough the circuit for a multiplexer is regular (four transistors in parallel), the physical layout looks\\nsomewhat chaotic. \\n Multiplexers as they appear on the die. The metal layer has been removed to show the polysilicon and silicon. The \"tie-die\" patterns are due to thin-film effects where the oxide layer wasn\\'t completely removed. \\n The 8087 uses pass transistors for many circuits, not just multiplexers.\\nCircuits with pass transistors are different from regular logic gates\\nbecause the pass transistors provide no amplification. Instead, signals get weaker as they go through pass\\ntransistors.\\nTo solve this problem, inverters or buffers are inserted into the condition tree to boost signals;\\nthey are omitted from the diagram above. \\n The conditions \\n Of the 8087\\'s 49 different conditions, some are widely used in the microcode, while others are designed for\\na specific purpose and are only used once.\\nThe full set of conditions is described in a footnote 7 but I\\'ll give some highlights here. \\n Fifteen conditions examine the bits of the current instruction\\'s opcode. This allows\\none microcode routine to handle a group of similar instructions and then change behavior based on the specific\\ninstruction. For example, conditions test if the instruction is multiplication, if the instruction is an FILD/FIST\\n(integer load or store), or if the bottom bit of the opcode is set. 5 \\n The 8087 has three temporary registers\u2014tmpA, tmpB, and tmpC\u2014that hold values during computation.\\nVarious conditions examine the values in the tmpA and tmpB registers. 6 \\nIn particular, the 8087 uses an interesting way to store numbers internally: each 80-bit floating-point value also \\nhas two \"tag\" bits.\\nThese bits are mostly invisible to the programmer and can be thought of as metadata.\\nThe tag bits indicate if a register is empty, contains zero, contains a \"normal\" number, or contains a special\\nvalue such as NaN (Not a Number) or infinity.\\nThe 8087 uses the tag bits to optimize operations.\\nThe tags also detect stack overflow (storing to a non-empty stack register) or stack underflow (reading from\\nan empty stack register). \\n Other conditions are highly specialized. For instance, one condition looks at the rounding mode setting and\\nthe sign of the value to determine if the value should be rounded up or down.\\nOther conditions deal with exceptions such as numbers that are too small (i.e. denormalized) or numbers that\\nlose precision.\\nAnother condition tests if two values have the same sign or not.\\nYet another condition tests if two values have the same sign or not, but inverts the result if the current\\ninstruction is subtraction.\\nThe simplest condition is simply \"true\", allowing an unconditional branch. \\n For flexibility, conditions can be \"flipped\", either jumping if the condition is true or jumping if the condition is false.\\nThis is controlled by bit P of the microcode.\\nIn the circuitry, this is implemented by a gate that XORs the P bit with the condition. The result is that the\\nstate of the condition is flipped if bit P is set. \\n For a concrete example of how conditions are used, consider the\\n microcode routine \\nthat implements FCHS and FABS , the\\ninstructions to change the sign and compute the absolute value, respectively.\\nThese operations are almost the same (toggling the sign bit versus clearing the sign bit), so the same\\nmicrocode routine handles both instructions, with a jump instruction to handle the difference.\\nThe FABS and FCHS instructions were designed with identical opcodes,\\nexcept that the bottom bit is set for FABS .\\nThus, the microcode routine uses a condition that tests the bottom bit, allowing the routine to branch and\\nchange its behavior for FABS vs FCHS . \\n Looking at the relevant micro-instruction, it has the hex value\\n 0xc094 , or in binary 110 000001 001010 0 .\\nThe first three bits (ABC=110) specify the relative jump operation (100 would jump to a fixed target and 101 would\\nperform a subroutine call.)\\nBits D through I ( 000010 ) indicate the amount of the jump (+`). \\nBits J through O ( 001010 , hex 0a) specify the condition to test, in this case, the last bit of the instruction opcode.\\nThe final bit (P) would toggle the condition if set, (i.e. jump if false).\\nThus, for FABS , the jump instruction will jump ahead one micro-instruction.\\nThis has the effect of skipping the next micro-instruction, which sets the appropriate sign bit for\\n FCHS . \\n Conclusions \\n The 8087 performs floating-point operations much faster than the 8086 by using\\nspecial hardware, optimized for floating-point.\\nThe condition code circuitry is one example of this: the 8087\\ncan test a complicated condition in a single operation.\\nHowever, these complicated conditions make it much harder to understand the microcode.\\nBut by a combination of examining the circuitry and looking at the micocode, we\\'re making progress.\\nThanks to the members of the \"Opcode Collective\" for their hard work, especially Smartest Blob and Gloriouscow. \\n For updates, follow me on\\n Bluesky ( @righto.com ),\\nMastodon ( @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space ),\\nor RSS . \\n Notes and references \\n \\n \\n \\n The section of the die that I\\'ve labeled \"Microcode decode\" performs some of the microcode decoding, but\\nlarge parts of the decoding are scattered across the chip, close to the circuitry that needs the signals.\\nThis makes reverse-engineering the microcode much more difficult.\\nI thought that understanding the microcode would be straightforward, just examining a block of decode circuitry.\\nBut this project turned out to be much more complicated and I need to reverse-engineer the entire chip. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n A PLA is a \"Programmable Logic Array\". It is a technique to implement logic functions with grids of transistors.\\nA PLA can be used as a compressed ROM, holding data in a more compact representation.\\n(Saving space was very important in chips of this era.)\\nIn the 8087, PLAs are used to hold tables of microcode addresses. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n Note that the multiplexer circuit selects the condition corresponding to the binary value of the bits.\\nIn the example, bits 000110 (0x06) select condition 06. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The five top-level multiplexer inputs correspond to bit patterns 00, 011, 10, 110, and 111.\\nThat is, two inputs depend on bits J and K, while three inputs depend on bits J, K, and L.\\nThe bit pattern 010 is unused, corresponding to conditions 0x10 through 0x17, which aren\\'t implemented. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The 8087 acts as a co-processor with the 8086 processor.\\nThe 8086 instruction set is designed so instructions with a special \"ESCAPE\" sequence in the top 5 bits\\nare processed by the co-processor, in this case the 8087.\\nThus, the 8087 receives a 16-bit instruction, but only the bottom 11 bits are usable.\\nFor a memory operation, the second byte of the instruction is an 8086-style ModR/M byte.\\nFor instructions that don\\'t access memory, the second byte specifies more of the instruction and sometimes specifies the\\nstack register to use for the instruction. \\n The relevance of this is that the 8087\\'s microcode engine uses the 11 bits of the instruction to determine\\nwhich microcode routine to execute.\\nThe microcode also uses various condition codes to change behavior depending on different bits of the\\ninstruction. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n There is a complication with the tmpA and tmpB registers: they can be swapped with the micro-instruction\\n\"ABC.EF\". \\nThe motivation behind this is that if you have two arguments, you can use a micro-subroutine to load\\nan argument into tmpA, swap the registers, and then use the same subroutine to load the second argument\\ninto tmpA. The result is that the two arguments end up in tmpB and tmpA without any special coding in\\nthe subroutine. \\n The implementation doesn\\'t physically swap the registers, but renames them internally, which is\\nmuch more efficient.\\nA flip-flop is toggled every time the registers are swapped. If the flip-flop is set, a request goes\\nto one register, while if the flip-flop is clear, a request goes to the other register.\\n(Many processors use the same trick. For instance, the Intel 8080 has an instruction to exchange the\\nDE and HL registers. The Z80 has an instruction to swap register banks. In both cases, a flip-flop\\nrenames the registers, so the data doesn\\'t need to move.) \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The table below is the real meat of this post, the result of much circuit analysis. These details probably aren\\'t\\ninteresting to most people, so I\\'ve relegated the table to a footnote.\\nDescriptions in italics are provided by Smartest Blob based on examination of the microcode.\\nGrayed-out lines are unused conditions. \\n The table has five sections, corresponding to the 5 inputs to the top-level condition multiplexer.\\nThese inputs come from different parts of the chip, so the sections correspond to different categories of\\nconditions. \\n The first section consists of instruction parsing, with circuitry near the microcode engine.\\nThe description shows the 11-bit opcode pattern that triggers the condition, with 0 bits and 1 bits as\\nspecified, and X indicating a \"don\\'t care\" bit that can be 0 or 1.\\nWhere simpler, I list the relevant instructions instead. \\n The next section indicates conditions on the exponent. I am still investigating these conditions, so\\nthe descriptions are incomplete.\\nThe third section is conditions on the temporary registers or conditions related to the control register.\\nThese circuits are to the right of the microcode ROM. \\n Conditions in the fourth section examine the floating-point bus, with circuitry near the bottom of the chip.\\nConditions 34 and 35 use a special 16-bit bidirectional shift register, at the far right of the chip.\\nThe top bit from the floating-point bus is shifted in. Maybe this shift register is used for CORDIC\\ncalculations?\\nThe conditions in the final block are miscellaneous, including the always-true condition 3e, which is used\\nfor unconditional jumps. \\n \\n \\n Cond.

First, a machine code instruction results in the execution of multiple\\nmicrocode instructions.\\nUsing the ALU is a two-step process: one microcode instruction (micro-instruction) configures the ALU for the desired operation,\\nwhile a second\\nmicro-instruction gets the results from the ALU.\\nMoreover, based on both the microcode micro-instruction and the machine code instruction, the control circuitry sends control signals to the ALU,\\nreconfiguring it for the desired operation.\\nThus, this circuitry provides the \"glue\" between the micro-instructions and the ALU. \\n The die photo below shows the 8086 processor under a microscope.\\nI\\'ve labeled the key functional blocks.\\nArchitecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top and an Execution Unit (EU) below.\\nThe BIU handles bus and memory activity as well as instruction prefetching, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes the instructions.\\nIn the lower right corner, the microcode ROM holds the micro-instructions.\\nThe ALU is in the lower left corner, with bits 7-0 above and bits 15-8 below, sandwiching the status flag circuitry.\\nThe ALU control circuitry, highlighted in red at the bottom of the chip, is the focus of this article. \\n The die of the 8086. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version. \\n Microcode \\n The 8086 processor implements most machine instructions in microcode, with a micro-instruction for each step of the machine instruction.\\n(I discuss the 8086\\'s microcode in detail here .)\\nThe 8086 uses an interesting architecture for microcode:\\neach micro-instruction performs two unrelated operations. The first operation moves data between a source and a destination.\\nThe second operation can range from a jump or subroutine call to a memory read/write or an ALU operation.\\nAn ALU operation has a five-bit field to specify a particular operation and a two-bit field to specify\\nwhich temporary register provides the input. As you\\'ll see below, these two fields play an important role in the ALU circuitry. \\n In many cases, the 8086\\'s micro-instruction doesn\\'t specify the ALU operation, leaving the details to be substituted from the machine instruction opcode.\\nFor instance, the ADD, SUB, ADC, SBB, AND, OR, XOR, and CMP\\nmachine instructions share the same microcode, while the hardware selects the ALU operation from the instruction opcode.\\nLikewise, the increment and decrement instructions use the same microcode, as do the decimal adjust instructions DAA and DAS, and the\\nASCII adjust instructions AAA and AAS.\\nInside the micro-instruction, all these operations are performed with a \"pseudo\" ALU operation called XI (for some reason).\\nIf the microcode specifies an XI ALU operation, the hardware replaces it with the ALU operation specified in the instruction.\\nAnother important feature of the microcode is \\nthat you need to perform one ALU micro-instruction to configure the ALU\\'s operation, but the result isn\\'t\\navailable until a later micro-instruction, which moves the result to a destination.\\nThis has the consequence that the hardware must remember the ALU operation. \\n To make this concrete, here is the microcode that implements a typical arithmetic instruction such as ADD AL, BL or XOR [BX+DI], CX .\\nThis microcode consists of three micro-instructions. \\nThe left half of each micro-instruction specifies a data movement, first moving the two arguments to ALU temporary registers\\nand then storing the ALU result (called \u03a3).\\nThe right half of each micro-instruction performs the second task.\\nFirst, the ALU is configured to perform an XI operation using temporary register A. Recall that XI indicates the ALU operation\\nis filled in from the machine instruction; this is how the same microcode handles eight different types of machine instructions.\\nIn the second micro-instruction, the next machine instruction is started unless a memory writeback is required ( WB ).\\nThe last micro-instruction is RNI (Run Next Instruction) to start a new machine instruction. It also indicates that the\\nprocessor status flags ( F ) should be updated to indicate if the ALU result is zero, positive, overflow, and so forth. 2 \\n\\n \\nM \u2192 tmpa   XI   tmpa Load first argument, configure ALU. \\nR \u2192 tmpb   WB,NXT Load second argument, start Next instruction if no memory writeback \\n\u03a3 \u2192 M      RNI  F Store ALU result, Run Next Instruction, update status Flags \\n \\n\\n The ALU circuit \\n The ALU is the heart of a processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations.\\nMicroprocessors of the 1970s typically supported addition and subtraction; logical AND, OR, and XOR; and various bit shift operations.\\n(Although the 8086 had multiply and divide instructions, these were implemented in microcode, not in the ALU.)\\nSince an ALU is both large and critical to performance, chip architects try to optimize its design.\\nAs a result, different microprocessors have widely different ALU designs.\\nFor instance, the 6502 microprocessor has separate circuits for addition and each logic operation; a multiplexer selects the appropriate\\noutput.\\nThe Intel 8085, on the other hand, uses an optimized clump of gates that performs the desired operation based on control signals ( details ), while the Z80\\'s 4-bit ALU uses a different clump of gates ( details ). \\n The 8086 takes a different approach, using two lookup tables (along with other gates) to generate the carry and output signals for each bit in the ALU.\\nBy setting the lookup tables appropriately, the ALU can be configured to perform the desired operation.\\n(This is similar to how an FPGA implements arbitrary functions through lookup tables.)\\nThe schematic below shows the circuit for one bit of the ALU.\\nI won\\'t explain this circuit in detail since I explained it in an earlier article . 3 \\nThe relevant part of this circuit is the six control signals at the left.\\nThe two multiplexers (trapezoidal symbols) implement the lookup tables by using the two input argument bits to select outputs from\\nthe control signals to control carry generation and carry propagation.\\nThus, by feeding appropriate control signals into the ALU, the 8086 can reconfigure the ALU to perform the desired operation.\\nFor instance, with one set of control signals, this circuit will add. Other sets of control signals will cause the circuit to subtract\\nor compute a logical operation, such as AND or XOR.\\nThe 8086 has 16 copies of this circuit, so it operates on 16-bit values. \\n The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086\\'s ALU. \\n The 8086 is a complicated processor, and its instructions have many special cases, so controlling the ALU is\\nmore complex than described above.\\nFor instance, the compare operation is the same as a subtraction, except the numerical result of a compare is discarded; just the\\nstatus flags are updated.\\nThe add versus add-with-carry instructions require different values for the carry into bit 0, while subtraction requires the\\ncarry flag to be inverted since it is treated as a borrow.\\nThe 8086\\'s ALU supports increment and decrement operations, but also increment and decrement by 2, which requires an increment signal into bit\\n1 instead of bit 0.\\nThe bit-shift operations all require special treatment. For instance, a rotate can use the carry bit or exclude the carry bit, while\\nand arithmetic shift right requires the top bit to be duplicated.\\nAs a result, along with the six lookup table (LUT) control signals, the ALU also requires numerous control signals to adjust its\\nbehavior for specific instructions.\\nIn the next section, I\\'ll explain how these control signals are generated. \\n ALU control circuitry on the die \\n The diagram below shows the components of the ALU control logic as they appear on the die.\\nThe information from the micro-instruction enters at the right and is stored in the latches.\\nThe PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays) decode the instruction and generate the control signals.\\nThese signals flow to the left, where they control the ALU. \\n The ALU control logic as it appears on the die. I removed the metal layer to show the underlying polysilicon and silicon. The reddish lines are remnants of the metal. \\n As explained earlier, if the microcode specifies the XI operation, the operation field is replaced with a value based on the machine instruction opcode.\\nThis substitution is performed by the XI multiplexer before the value is stored in the operation latch.\\nBecause of the complexity of the 8086 instruction set, the XI operation is not as straightforward as you might expect.\\nThis multiplexer gets three instruction bits from a special register called the \"X\" register, another instruction bit from the instruction\\nregister, and the final bit from a decoding circuit called the Group Decode ROM. 4 \\n Recall that one micro-instruction specifies the ALU operation, and a later micro-instruction accesses the result. Thus, the\\nALU control circuitry must remember the specified operation so it can be used later. \\nIn particular, the control circuitry must keep track of the ALU operation to perform and the temporary register specified.\\nThe control circuitry uses three flip-flops to keep track of the specified temporary register, one flip-flop for each register.\\nThe micro-instruction contains a two-bit field that specifies the temporary register. The control circuitry decodes this field and\\nactivates the associated flip-flop.\\nThe outputs from these flip-flops go to the ALU and enable the associated temporary register.\\nAt the start of each machine instruction, 5 the flip-flops are reset, so temporary register A is selected by default. \\n The control circuitry uses five flip-flops to store the five-bit operation field from the micro-instruction.\\nAt the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset so operation 0 (ADD) is specified by default.\\nOne important consequence is that an add operation can potentially be performed without a micro-instruction to configure the ALU,\\nshortening the microcode by one micro-instruction and thus shortening the instruction time by one cycle. \\n The five-bit output from the operation flip-flops goes to the operation PLA (Programmable Logic Array) 7 , which decodes the operation\\ninto 27 control signals. 6 \\nMany of these signals go to the ALU, where they control the behavior of the ALU for special cases.\\nAbout 15 of these signals go to the Lookup Table (LUT) PLA, which generates the six lookup table signals for the ALU.\\nAt the left side of the LUT PLA, special high-current driver circuits amplify the control signals before they are sent to the ALU.\\nDetails on these drivers are in the footnotes. 8 \\n Conclusions \\n Whenever I look at the circuitry of the 8086 processor, I see the differences between a RISC chip and a CISC chip.\\nIn a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor such as ARM, instruction decoding is straightforward, as is the processor circuitry.\\nBut in the 8086, a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) processor, there are corner cases and complications everywhere.\\nFor instance, an 8086 machine instruction sometimes specifies the ALU operation in the first byte and sometimes in the second byte,\\nand sometimes elsewhere, so the X register latch, the XI multiplexer, and the Group Decode ROM are needed.\\nThe 8086\\'s ALU includes obscure operations including four types of BCD adjustments and seven types of shifts, making the ALU more\\ncomplicated.\\nOf course, the continuing success of x86 shows that this complexity also has benefits. \\n This article has been a deep dive into the details of the 8086\\'s ALU, but I hope you have found it interesting.\\nIf it\\'s too much detail for you, you might prefer my overview of the 8086 ALU . \\n For updates, follow me on\\n Bluesky ( @righto.com ),\\nMastodon ( @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space ),\\nor RSS . \\n Credits:\\nThanks to Marcin Peczarski for discussion.\\nMy microcode analysis is based on Andrew Jenner\\'s 8086 microcode disassembly . \\n Notes and references \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The operations implemented by the ALU are: \\n \\n 00 ADD Add \\n 01 OR Logical OR \\n 02 ADC Add with carry in \\n 03 SBB Subtract with borrow in \\n 04 AND Logical AND \\n 05 SUBT Subtract \\n 06 XOR Logical XOR \\n 07 CMP Comparison \\n 08 ROL Rotate left \\n 09 ROR Rotate right \\n 0a LRCY Left rotate through carry \\n 0b RRCY Right rotate through carry \\n 0c SHL Shift left \\n 0d SHR Shift right \\n 0e SETMO Set to minus one ( questionable ) \\n 0f SAR Arithmetic shift right \\n 10 PASS Pass argument unchanged \\n 11 XI Instruction specifies ALU op \\n 14 DAA Decimal adjust after addition \\n 15 DAS Decimal adjust after subtraction \\n 16 AAA ASCII adjust after addition \\n 17 AAS ASCII adjust after subtraction \\n 18 INC Increment \\n 19 DEC Decrement \\n 1a COM1 1\\'s complement \\n 1b NEG Negate \\n 1c INC2 Increment by 2 \\n 1d DEC2 Decrement by 2 \\n \\n Also see Andrew Jenner\\'s code . \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n You might wonder how this microcode handles the 8086\\'s complicated addressing modes such as [BX+DI] .\\nThe trick is that microcode subroutines implement the addressing modes.\\nFor details, see my article on 8086 addressing microcode . \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The 8086\\'s ALU has a separate circuit to implement shift-right.\\nThe problem is that data in an ALU normally flows right-to-left as carries flow from lower bits to higher bits.\\nShifting data to the right goes against this direction, so it requires a special path.\\n(Shifting to the left is straightforward; you can add a number to itself.) \\n The adjust operations (DAA, DAS, AAA, AAS) also use completely separate circuitry.\\nThese operations generate correction factors for BCD (binary-coded decimal) arithmetic based on the value and flags.\\nThe circuitry for these operations is located with the flags circuitry, separate from the rest of the ALU circuitry. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n In more detail, the 8086 stores bits 5-3 of the machine instruction in the \"X\" register.\\nFor an XI operation, the X register bits become bits 2-0 of the ALU operation specification, while bit 3 comes from bit 6 of the\\ninstruction, and bit 4 comes from the Group Decode ROM for\\ncertain instructions.\\nThe point of this is that the instruction set is designed so bits of the instruction correspond to bits of the ALU operation\\nspecifier, but the mapping is more complicated than you might expect.\\nThe eight basic arithmetic/logic operations (ADD, SUB, OR, etc) have a straightforward mapping that is visible from\\nthe 8086 opcode table , but the mapping for other instructions isn\\'t as obvious.\\nMoreover, sometimes the operation is specified in the first byte of the machine instruction, but sometimes it is specified\\nin the second byte, which is why the X register needs to store the relevant bits. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The flip-flops are reset by a signal in the 8086, called \"Second Clock\". When a new machine instruction is started, the \"First Clock\" signal\\nis generated on the instruction\\'s first byte and the \"Second Clock\" signal is generated on the instruction\\'s second byte.\\n(Note that these signals are not necessarily on consecutive clock cycles, because a memory fetch may be required if the\\ninstruction queue is empty.)\\nWhy are the flip-flops reset on Second Clock and not First Clock? The 8086 has a small degree of pipelining, so the previous\\nmicro-instruction may still be finishing up during First Clock of the next instruction. By Second Clock, it is safe to reset\\nthe ALU state. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n For reference, the 27 outputs from the PLA are triggered by the following ALU micro-operations: \\n Output 0: RRCY (right rotate through carry) \\n Output 1: ROR (Rotate Right) \\n Output 2: BCD Adjustments: DAA (Decimal Adjust after Addition), DAS (Decimal Adjust after Subtraction), AAA (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction), or AAS (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction) \\n Output 3: SAR (Shift Arithmetic Right)\\n Output 4: Left shift: ROL (Rotate Left), RCL (Rotate through Carry Left), SHL (Shift Left), or SETMO (Set Minus One)\\n Output 5: Right shift: ROR (Rotate Right), RCR (Rotate through Carry Right), SHR (Shift Right), or SAR (Shift Arithmetic Right)\\n Output 6: INC2 (increment by 2) \\n Output 7: ROL (Rotate Left) \\n Output 8: RCL (Rotate through Carry Left)\\n Output 9: ADC (add with carry) \\n Output 10: DEC2 (decrement by 2) \\n Output 11: INC (increment) \\n Output 12: NEG (negate) \\n Output 13: ALU operation 12 (unused?)\\n Output 14: SUB (Subtract), CMP (Compare), DAS (Decimal Adjust after Subtraction), AAS (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction)\\n Output 15: SBB (Subtract with Borrow) \\n Output 16: ROL (Rotate Left) or RCL (Rotate through Carry Left)\\n Output 17: ADD or ADC (Add with Carry)\\n Output 18: DEC or DEC2 (Decrement by 1 or 2)\\n Output 19: PASS (pass-through) or INC (Increment)\\n Output 20: COM1 (1\\'s Complement) or NEG (Negate) \\n Output 21: XOR \\n Output 22: OR \\n Output 23: AND \\n Output 24: SHL (Shift Left)\\n Output 25: DAA or AAA (Decimal/ASCII Adjust after Addition)\\n Output 26: CMP (Compare) \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n A Programmable Logic Array is a way of implementing logic gates in a structured grid. PLAs are often used in microprocessors because\\nthey provide a dense way of implementing logic.\\nA PLA normally consists of two layers: an \"OR\" layer and an \"AND\" layer. Together, the layers produce \"sum-of-products\" outputs,\\nconsisting of multiple terms OR\\'d together.\\nThe ALU\\'s PLA is a bit unusual because many outputs are taken directly from the OR layer, while only about 15 outputs from the\\nfirst layer are fed into the second layer. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The control signals pass through the driver circuit below.\\nThe operation of this circuit puzzled me for years, since the transistor with its gate at +5V seems to be stuck on.\\nBut I was looking at the book DRAM Circuit Design and spotted the same circuit, called \\nthe \"Bootstrap Wordline Driver\".\\nThe purpose of this circuit is to boost the output to a higher voltage than a regular NMOS circuit, providing better performance.\\nThe problem with NMOS circuitry is that NMOS transistors aren\\'t very good at pulling a signal high: due to the properties of the\\ntransistor, the output voltage is less than the gate voltage, lower by the threshold voltage V TH , half a volt or more. \\n The drive signals to the ALU gates are generated with this dynamic circuit. \\n The bootstrap circuit takes advantage of capacitance to get more voltage out of the circuit.\\nSpecifically, suppose the input is +5V, while the clock is high. Point A will be about 4.5V, losing half a volt due to the threshold.\\nNow, suppose the clock goes low, so the inverted clock driving the upper transistor goes high.\\nDue to capacitance in the second transistor, as the source and drain go high, the gate will\\nbe pulled above its previous voltage, maybe gaining a couple of volts.\\nThe high voltage on the gate produces a full-voltage output, avoiding\\nthe drop due to V TH .\\nBut why the transistor with its gate at +5V? This transistor acts somewhat like a diode, preventing the boosted voltage from flowing\\nbackward through the input and dissipating. \\n The bootstrap circuit is used on the ALU\\'s lookup table control signals for two reasons.\\nFirst, these control signals drive pass transistors. A pass transistor suffers from a voltage drop due to the threshold voltage,\\nso you want to start with a control signal with as high a voltage as possible.\\nSecond, each control signal is connected to 16 transistors (one for each bit).\\nThis is a large number of transistors to drive from one signal, since each transistor has gate capacitance.\\nIncreasing the voltage helps overcome the R-C (resistor-capacitor) delay, improving performance. \\n A close-up of the bootstrap drive circuits, in the left half of the LUT PLA. \\n The diagram above shows six bootstrap drivers on the die. At the left are the transistors that ground the signals when clock is\\nhigh. The +5V transistors are scattered around the image; two of them are labeled.\\nThe six large transistors provide the output signal, controlled by clock\\'.\\nNote that these transistors are much larger than the other transistors because they must produce the high-current output,\\nwhile the other transistors have more of a supporting role. \\n (Bootstrap circuits go way back; Federico Faggin designed a bootstrap circuit for the Intel 8008 that he claimed \"proved essential to the microprocessor realization.\") \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n '}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 12:51:49</p>"},{"location":"righto.com/Solving%20the%20NYTimes%20Pips%20puzzle%20with%20a%20constraint%20solver_20251018/","title":"Solving the NYTimes Pips puzzle with a constraint solver","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: righto.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: 2025-10-18T08:41:00.000-07:00 \u94fe\u63a5: http://www.righto.com/2025/10/solve-nyt-pips-with-constraints.html</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default', 'value': ' The New York Times recently introduced a new daily puzzle called Pips .\\nYou place a set of dominoes on a grid, satisfying various conditions.\\nFor instance, in the puzzle below,\\nthe pips (dots) in the purple squares must sum to 8,\\nthere must be fewer than 5 pips in the red square, and the pips in the three green squares must be equal.\\n(It doesn\\'t take much thought to solve this \"easy\" puzzle, but the \"medium\" and \"hard\" puzzles\\nare more challenging.) \\n The New York Times Pips puzzle from Oct 5, 2025 (easy). Hint: What value must go in the three green squares? \\n I was wondering about how to solve these puzzles with a computer.\\nRecently, I saw an article on Hacker News \u2014\" Many hard LeetCode problems are easy constraint problems \"\u2014that described the benefits and flexibility of a system called\\na constraint solver.\\nA constraint solver takes a set of constraints and finds solutions that satisfy the constraints: exactly\\nwhat Pips requires. \\n I figured that solving Pips with a constraint solver would be a good way to learn more about these\\nsolvers, but I had several questions.\\nDid constraint solvers require incomprehensible mathematics?\\nHow hard was it to express a problem? Would the solver quickly solve the problem, or\\nwould it get caught in an exponential search? \\n It turns out that using a constraint solver was straightforward; it took me under two hours from\\nknowing nothing about constraint solvers to solving the problem.\\nThe solver found solutions in milliseconds (for the most part).\\nHowever, there were a few bumps along the way.\\nIn this blog post, I\\'ll discuss my experience with the MiniZinc 1 constraint\\nmodeling system and show how it can solve Pips. \\n Approaching the problem \\n Writing a program for a constraint solver is very different from writing a regular program.\\nInstead of telling the computer how to solve the problem, you tell it what you want:\\nthe conditions that must be satisfied.\\nThe solver then \"magically\" finds solutions that satisfy the problem. \\n To solve the problem, I created an array called pips that holds the number of domino pips at each position\\nin the grid.\\nThen, the three constraints for the above problem can be expressed as follows.\\nYou can see how the constraints directly express the conditions in the puzzle. \\n \\nconstraint pips[1,1] + pips[2,1] == 8;\\nconstraint pips[2,3] &lt; 5;\\nconstraint all_equal([pips[3,1], pips[3,2], pips[3,3]]);\\n \\n\\n Next, I needed to specify where dominoes could be placed for the puzzle.\\nTo do this, I defined an array called grid that indicated the allowable positions: 1 indicates a valid\\nposition and 0 indicates an invalid position. (If you compare with the puzzle at the top of the article,\\nyou can see that the grid below matches its shape.) \\n \\ngrid = [|\\n1,1,0|\\n1,1,1|\\n1,1,1|];\\n \\n\\n I also defined the set of dominoes for the problem above, specifying the number of spots in each half: \\n \\nspots = [|5,1| 1,4| 4,2| 1,3|];\\n \\n\\n So far, the constraints directly match the problem.\\nHowever, I needed to write some more code to specify how these pieces interact.\\nBut\\nbefore I describe that code, I\\'ll show a solution.\\nI wasn\\'t sure what to expect: would the constraint solver give me a solution or would it spin\\nforever?\\nIt turned out to find the unique solution in 109 milliseconds, printing out the\\nsolution arrays.\\nThe pips array shows the number of pips in each position, while the dominogrid array shows which\\ndomino (1 through 4) is in each position. \\n \\npips = \\n[| 4, 2, 0\\n | 4, 5, 3\\n | 1, 1, 1\\n |];\\ndominogrid = \\n[| 3, 3, 0\\n | 2, 1, 4\\n | 2, 1, 4\\n |];\\n \\n\\n The text-based solution above is a bit ugly.\\nBut it is easy to create graphical output.\\nMiniZinc provides a JavaScript API, so you can easily display\\nsolutions on a web page.\\nI wrote a few lines of JavaScript to draw the solution, as shown below.\\n(I just display the numbers since I was too lazy to draw the dots.)\\nSolving this puzzle is not too impressive\u2014it\\'s an \"easy\" puzzle after all\u2014but I\\'ll show below that\\nthe solver can also handle considerably more difficult puzzles. \\n Graphical display of the solution. \\n Details of the code \\n While the above code specifies a particular puzzle, a bit more code is required to define\\nhow dominoes and the grid interact.\\nThis code may appear strange because it is implemented as constraints, rather than the\\nprocedural operations in a normal program. \\n My main design decision was how to specify the locations of dominoes.\\nI considered assigning a grid position and orientation\\nto each domino, but it seemed inconvenient to deal with multiple orientations.\\nInstead, I decided to position each half of the domino independently, with an x and y coordinate in\\nthe grid. 2 I added a constraint that the two halves of each domino had to be in neighboring cells,\\nthat is, either the X or Y coordinates had to differ by 1. \\n \\nconstraint forall(i in DOMINO) (abs(x[i, 1] - x[i, 2]) + abs(y[i, 1] - y[i, 2]) == 1);\\n \\n\\n It took a bit of thought to fill in the pips array with the number of spots on each domino.\\nIn a normal programming language, one would loop over the dominoes and store the values into pips .\\nHowever, here it is done with a constraint so the solver makes sure the values are assigned.\\nSpecifically, for each half-domino, the pips array entry at\\nthe domino\\'s x/y coordinate must equal the corresponding spots on the domino: \\n \\nconstraint forall(i in DOMINO, j in HALF) (pips[y[i,j], x[i, j]] == spots[i, j]);\\n \\n\\n I decided to add another array to keep track of which domino is in which position.\\nThis array is useful to see the domino locations in the output, but it also\\nkeeps dominoes from overlapping.\\nI used a constraint to put each domino\\'s number (1, 2, 3, etc.) into the occupied position of dominogrid : \\n \\nconstraint forall(i in DOMINO, j in HALF) (dominogrid[y[i,j], x[i, j]] == i);\\n \\n\\n Next, how do we make sure that dominoes only go into positions allowed by grid ?\\nI used a constraint that a square in dominogrid must be empty or the corresponding grid must allow a domino. 3 \\nThis uses the \"or\" condition, which is expressed as \\/ , an unusual stylistic\\nchoice. (Likewise, \"and\" is expressed as /\\ . These correspond to the logical symbols\\n\u2228 and \u2227.) \\n \\nconstraint forall(i in 1..H, j in 1..W) (dominogrid[i, j] == 0 \\/ grid[i, j] != 0);\\n \\n\\n Honestly, I was worried that I had too many arrays and the solver would end up in a rathole ensuring that the arrays were consistent.\\nBut I figured I\\'d try this brute-force approach and see if it worked.\\nIt turns out that it worked for the most part, so I didn\\'t need to do anything more clever. \\n Finally, the program requires a few lines to define some constants and variables.\\nThe constants below define the number of dominoes and the size of the grid for a particular problem: \\n \\nint: NDOMINO = 4; % Number of dominoes in the puzzle\\nint: W = 3; % Width of the grid in this puzzle\\nint: H = 3; % Height of the grid in this puzzle\\n \\n\\n Next, datatypes are defined to specify the allowable values.\\nThis is very important for the solver; it is a \"finite domain\" solver, so limiting the size of\\nthe domains reduces the size of the problem.\\nFor this problem, the values are integers in a particular range, called a set : \\n \\nset of int: DOMINO = 1..NDOMINO; % Dominoes are numbered 1 to NDOMINO\\nset of int: HALF = 1..2; % The domino half is 1 or 2\\nset of int: xcoord = 1..W; % Coordinate into the grid\\nset of int: ycoord = 1..H;\\n \\n\\n At last, I define the sizes and types of the various arrays that I use.\\nOne very important syntax is var , which indicates variables that the solver must determine.\\nNote that the first two arrays, grid and spots do not have var since they are constant,\\ninitialized to specify the problem. \\n \\narray[1..H,1..W] of 0..1: grid; % The grid defining where dominoes can go\\narray[DOMINO, HALF] of int: spots; % The number of spots on each half of each domino\\narray[DOMINO, HALF] of var xcoord: x; % X coordinate of each domino half\\narray[DOMINO, HALF] of var ycoord: y; % Y coordinate of each domino half\\narray[1..H,1..W] of var 0..6: pips; % The number of pips (0 to 6) at each location.\\narray[1..H,1..W] of var 0..NDOMINO: dominogrid; % The domino sequence number at each location\\n \\n\\n You can find all the code on GitHub .\\nOne weird thing is that because the code is not procedural, the lines can be in any order.\\nYou can use arrays or constants before you use them.\\nYou can even move include statements to the end of the file if you want! \\n Complications \\n Overall, the solver was much easier to use than I expected. However, there were a few complications. \\n By changing a setting, the solver can find multiple solutions instead of stopping after the first.\\nHowever, when I tried this, the solver generated thousands of meaningless solutions.\\nA closer look showed that the problem was that the solver was putting arbitrary numbers into the \"empty\"\\ncells, creating valid but pointlessly different solutions.\\nIt turns out that I didn\\'t explicitly forbid this, so the sneaky constraint solver went ahead and\\ngenerated tons of solutions that I didn\\'t want.\\nAdding another constraint fixed the problem.\\nThe moral is that even if you think your constraints are clear, solvers are very good at finding unwanted\\nsolutions that technically satisfy the constraints.\\n 4 \\n A second problem is that if you do something wrong, the solver simply says that the problem is\\nunsatisfiable. Maybe there\\'s a clever way of debugging, but I ended up removing constraints until\\nthe problem can be satisfied, and then see what I did wrong with that constraint.\\n(For instance, I got the array indices backward at one point, making the problem insoluble.) \\n The most concerning issue is the unpredictability of the solver:\\nmaybe it will take milliseconds or maybe it will take hours.\\nFor instance, the Oct 5 hard Pips puzzle (below) caused the solver to take minutes for no apparent reason.\\nHowever, the MiniZinc IDE supports different solver backends. I switched from the default Gecode solver to\\n Chuffed , and it immediately found numerous solutions, 384 to\\nbe precise.\\n(Sometimes the Pips puzzles sometimes have multiple solutions, which players find controversial .)\\nI suspect that the multiple solutions messed up the Gecode solver somehow, perhaps because\\nit couldn\\'t narrow down a \"good\" branch in the search tree.\\nFor a benchmark of the different solvers, see the footnote. 5 \\n Two of the 384 solutions to the NYT Pips puzzle from Oct 5, 2025 (hard difficulty). \\n How does a constraint solver work? \\n If you were writing a program to solve Pips from scratch, you\\'d probably have a loop to try\\nassigning dominoes to positions.\\nThe problem is that the problem grows exponentially. If you have 16 dominoes, there are 16 choices\\nfor the first domino, 15 choices for the second, and so forth, so about 16! combinations in total,\\nand that\\'s ignoring orientations.\\nYou can think of this as a search tree: at the first step, you have 16 branches. For the next step,\\neach branch has 15 sub-branches. Each sub-branch has 14 sub-sub-branches, and so forth. \\n An easy optimization is to check the constraints after each domino is added. For instance, as soon\\nas the \\n\"less than 5\" constraint is violated, you can backtrack and skip that entire\\nsection of the tree.\\nIn this way, only a subset of the tree needs to be searched; the number of branches will be large, but\\nhopefully manageable. \\n A constraint solver works similarly, but in a more abstract way.\\nThe constraint solver assigns values to the variables, backtracking when a conflict is detected.\\nSince the underlying problem is typically NP-complete, the solver uses heuristics to attempt to\\nimprove performance.\\nFor instance, variables can be assigned in different orders. The solver attempts to generate\\nconflicts as soon as possible so large pieces of the search tree can be pruned sooner rather than later.\\n(In the domino case, this corresponds to placing dominoes in places with the tightest constraints, rather\\nthan scattering them around the puzzle in \"easy\" spots.) \\n Another technique is constraint propagation. The idea is that you can derive new constraints and\\ncatch conflicts earlier. For instance, suppose you have a problem with the constraints \"a equals c\" and \"b equals c\".\\nIf you assign \"a=1\" and \"b=2\", you won\\'t find a conflict until later, when you try to find a value for \"c\".\\nBut with constraint propagation, you can derive a new constraint \"a equals b\", and the problem will\\nturn up immediately.\\n(Solvers handle more complicated constraint propagation, such as inequalities.)\\nThe tradeoff is that generating new constraints takes time and makes the problem larger, so constraint\\npropagation can make the solver slower. Thus, heuristics are used to decide when to apply constraint propagation. \\n Researchers are actively developing new\\nalgorithms, heuristics, and optimizations 6 such as backtracking more aggressively\\n(called \"backjumping\"),\\nkeeping track of failing variable assignments (called \"nogoods\"), and\\nleveraging Boolean SAT (satisfiability) solvers.\\nSolvers compete in annual challenges to test\\nthese techniques against each other.\\nThe nice thing about a constraint solver is that you don\\'t need to know anything about these techniques;\\nthey are applied automatically. \\n Conclusions \\n I hope this has convinced you that constraint solvers are interesting, not too scary, and can solve\\nreal problems with little effort.\\nEven as a beginner, I was able to get started with MiniZinc quickly.\\n(I read half the tutorial and then jumped into programming.) \\n One reason to look at constraint solvers is that they are a completely different programming paradigm.\\nUsing a constraint solver is like programming on a higher level, not worrying about how the problem\\ngets solved or what algorithm gets used.\\nMoreover, analyzing a problem in terms of constraints is a different way of thinking about algorithms.\\nSome of the time it\\'s frustrating when you can\\'t use familiar constructs such as loops and assignments,\\nbut it expands your horizons. \\n Finally,\\nwriting code to solve Pips is more fun than solving the problems by hand, at least in my opinion,\\nso give it a try! \\n For more, follow me on\\n Bluesky ( @righto.com ),\\nMastodon ( @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space ),\\n RSS , or subscribe here . \\n Solution to the Pips puzzle, September 21, 2005 (hard). This puzzle has regions that must all be equal (=) and regions that must all be different (\u2260). Conveniently, MiniZinc has all_equal and alldifferent constraint functions. \\n Notes and references \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nI started by downloading the MiniZinc IDE and reading the\\n MiniZinc tutorial . The MiniZinc IDE is straightforward, with an editor window at the top and an output window at\\nthe bottom. Clicking the \"Run\" button causes it to generate a solution. \\n Screenshot of the MiniZinc IDE.

I fixed this by adding constraints for each symmetric domino\\nto allow only one of the two redundant positions. The constraint below forces a preferred\\norientation for symmetric dominoes. \\n \\nconstraint forall(i in DOMINO) (spots[i,1] != spots[i,2] \\/ x[i,1] &gt; x[i,2] \\/ (x[i,1] == x[i,2] /\\ y[i,1] &gt; y[i,2]));\\n \\n To enable multiple solutions in MiniZinc, the setting is under Show Configuration Editor &gt; User Defined Behavior &gt;\\nSatisfaction Problems or the --all flag from the command line. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n MiniZinc has five solvers that can solve this sort of integer problem: Chuffed ,\\n OR Tools CP-SAT ,\\n Gecode ,\\n HiGHS ,\\nand Coin-OR BC .\\nI measured the performance of the five solvers against 20 different Pips puzzles.\\nMost of the solvers found solutions in under a second, most of the time, but there is a lot\\nof variation. \\n Timings for different solvers on 20 Pip puzzles. \\n Overall, Chuffed had the best performance on the puzzles that I tested, taking well under a second.\\nGoogle\\'s OR-Tools won all\\nthe categories in the 2025 MiniZinc challenge ,\\nbut it was considerably slower than Chuffed for my Pips programs.\\nThe default Gecode solver performed very well most of the time, but it did terribly on a few\\nproblems, taking over 15 minutes.\\nHiGHs was slower in general, taking a few minutes on the hardest problems, but it didn\\'t fail\\nas badly as Gecode.\\n(Curiously, Gecode and HiGHS sometimes found different problems to be difficult.)\\nFinally, Coin-OR BC was uniformly bad; at best it took a few seconds, but one puzzle took almost two\\nhours and others weren\\'t solved before I gave up after two hours.\\n(I left Coin-OR BC off the graph because it messed up the scale.) \\n Don\\'t treat these results too seriously because different solvers are optimized for\\ndifferent purposes. (In particular, Coin-OR BC is designed for linear problems.)\\nBut the results demonstrate the unpredictability of solvers: maybe you get a solution in a second\\nand maybe you get a solution in hours. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n If you want to read more about solvers, Constraint Satisfaction Problems is an overview presentation.\\nThe Gecode algorithms are described in a nice technical report: Constraint Programming Algorithms used in Gecode .\\nChuffed is more complicated: \"Chuffed is a state of the art lazy clause solver designed from the ground up with lazy clause generation in mind.

The die is 5mm\u00d76mm.  Click for a larger image. \\n The chip\\'s instructions are defined by the large microcode ROM in the middle.\\nThis ROM is very unusual; it is semi-analog, storing two bits per transistor by using four transistor sizes.\\nTo execute a floating-point instruction, the 8087 decodes the instruction and the microcode engine starts executing\\nthe appropriate micro-instructions from the microcode ROM.\\nThe decode circuitry to the right of the ROM generates the appropriate control signals from each micro-instruction.\\nThe bus registers and control circuitry handle interactions with the main 8086 processor and the rest of the system.\\nFinally, the bias generator \\nuses a charge pump to create a negative voltage to bias the chip\\'s substrate, the underlying silicon. \\n The stack registers and control circuitry (in red above) are the subject of this blog post. \\nUnlike most processors, the 8087 organizes its registers in a stack, with instructions operating on the top of the stack.\\nFor instance, the square root instruction replaces the value on the top of the stack with its square root.\\nYou can also access a register relative to the top of the stack, for instance, adding the top value to the value two positions down from the top.\\nThe stack-based architecture was intended to improve the instruction set, simplify compiler design, and make function\\ncalls more efficient, although it didn\\'t work as well as hoped. \\n The stack on the 8087. From The 8087 Primer , page 60. \\n The diagram above shows how the stack operates. The stack consists of eight registers, with the Stack Top\\n(ST) indicating the current top of the stack.\\nTo push a floating-point value onto the stack, the Stack Top is decremented and then the value is stored in the new top register.\\nA pop is performed by copying the value from the stack top and then incrementing the Stack Top.\\nIn comparison, most processors specify registers directly, so register 2 is always the same register. \\n The registers \\n The stack registers occupy a substantial area on the die of the 8087 because floating-point numbers take many bits.\\nA floating-point number consists of a fractional part (sometimes called the mantissa or significand), along with\\nthe exponent part; the exponent allows floating-point numbers to cover a range from extremely small to extremely\\nlarge.\\nIn the 8087, floating-point numbers are 80 bits: 64 bits of significand, 15 bits of exponent, and a sign bit.\\nAn 80-bit register was very large in the era of 8-bit or 16-bit computers; the eight registers in the 8087\\nwould be equivalent to 40 registers in the 8086 processor. \\n The registers in the 8087 form an 8\u00d780 grid of cells. The close-up shows an 8\u00d78 block. I removed the metal layer with acid to reveal the underlying silicon circuitry. \\n The registers store each bit in a static RAM cell. Each cell has two inverters connected in a loop.\\nThis circuit forms a stable feedback loop, with one inverter on and one inverter off.\\nDepending on which inverter is on, the circuit stores a 0 or a 1.\\nTo write a new value into the circuit, one of the lines is pulled low, flipping the loop into the desired state.\\nThe trick is that each inverter uses a very weak transistor to pull the output high, so its output is easily overpowered\\nto change the state. \\n Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1. \\n These inverter pairs are arranged in an 8 \u00d7 80 grid that implements eight words of 80 bits. Each of the 80 rows has two bitlines that provide access to a bit.\\nThe bitlines provide both read and write access to a bit; the pair of bitlines allows either inverter to be pulled low to store the desired bit value.\\nEight vertical wordlines enable access to one word, one column of 80 bits.\\nEach wordline turns on 160 pass transistors, connecting the bitlines to the inverters in the selected column.\\nThus, when a wordline is enabled, the bitlines can be used to read or write that word. \\n Although the chip looks two-dimensional, it actually consists of multiple layers.\\nThe bottom layer is silicon.\\nThe pinkish regions below are where the silicon has been \"doped\" to change its electrical properties, making it an active\\npart of the circuit.\\nThe doped silicon forms a grid of horizontal and vertical wiring, with larger doped regions in the middle.\\nOn top of the silicon, polysilicon wiring provides two functions. First, it provides a layer of wiring to connect the circuit.\\nBut more importantly, when polysilicon crosses doped silicon, it forms a transistor. The polysilicon provides the gate, turning the transistor on and off.\\nIn this photo, the polysilicon is barely visible, so I\\'ve highlighted part of it in red.\\nFinally, horizontal metal wires provide a third layer of interconnecting wiring.\\nNormally, the metal hides the underlying circuitry, so I removed the metal with acid for this photo.\\nI\\'ve drawn blue lines to represent the metal layer.\\nContacts provide connections between the various layers. \\n A close-up of a storage cell in the registers. The metal layer and most of the polysilicon have been removed to show the underlying silicon. \\n The layers combine to form the inverters and selection transistors of a memory cell, indicated with the dotted line below.\\nThere are six transistors (yellow), where polysilicon crosses doped silicon. Each inverter has a transistor that\\npulls the output low and a weak transistor to pull the output high.\\nWhen the word line (vertical polysilicon) is active, it connects the selected inverters to the bit lines (horizontal metal) through the two selection\\ntransistors.\\nThis allows the bit to be read or written. \\n The function of the circuitry in a storage cell. \\n Each register has two tag bits associated with it, an unusual form of metadata to indicate\\nif the register is empty, contains zero, contains a valid value, or\\ncontains a special value such as infinity.\\nThe tag bits are used to optimize performance internally and are mostly irrelevant to the programmer.\\nAs well as being accessed with a register, the tag bits can be accessed in parallel as a 16-bit \"Tag Word\".\\nThis allows the tags to be saved or loaded as part of the 8087\\'s state, for instance,\\nduring interrupt handling. \\n The decoder \\n The decoder circuit, wedged into the middle of the register file, selects one of the registers.\\nA register is specified internally with a 3-bit value. The decoder circuit energizes one of the eight register select\\nlines based on this value. \\n The decoder circuitry is straightforward: it has eight 3-input NOR gates to match one of the eight bit patterns.\\nThe select line is then powered through a high-current driver that uses large transistors.\\n(In the photo below, you can compare the large serpentine driver transistors to the small transistors in a bit cell.) \\n The decoder circuitry has eight similar blocks to drive the eight select lines. \\n The decoder has an interesting electrical optimization.\\nAs shown earlier, the register select lines are eight polysilicon lines running vertically, the length of the\\nregister file. \\nUnfortunately, polysilicon has fairly high resistance, better than silicon but much worse than metal.\\nThe problem is that the resistance of a long polysilicon line will slow down the system.\\nThat is, the capacitance of transistor gates in combination with high resistance causes an RC (resistive-capacitive) delay in the signal. \\n The solution is that the register select lines also run in the metal layer, a second set of lines immediately to the\\nright of the register file.\\nThese lines branch off from the register file about 1/3 of the way down, run to the bottom, and then connect back\\nto the polysilicon select lines at the bottom.\\nThis reduces the maximum resistance through a select line, increasing the speed. \\n A diagram showing how 8 metal lines run parallel to the main select lines. The register file is much taller than shown; the middle has been removed to make the diagram fit. \\n The stack control circuitry \\n A stack needs more control circuitry than a regular register file, since the circuitry must keep track of the\\nposition of the top of the stack. 3 \\nThe control circuitry increments and decrements the top of stack (TOS) pointer as values are pushed or popped\\n(purple). 4 \\nMoreover, an 8087 instruction can access a register based on its offset, for instance the third register\\nfrom the top.\\nTo support this, the control circuitry can temporarily add an offset to the top of stack position (green).\\nA multiplexer (red) selects either the top of stack or the adder output, and feeds it to the decoder (blue),\\nwhich selects one of the eight stack registers in the register file (yellow), as described earlier. \\n The register stack in the 8087. Adapted from Patent USRE33629E . I don\\'t know what the GRX field is. I also don\\'t know why this shows a subtractor and not an adder. \\n \\n\\n The physical implementation of the stack circuitry is shown below.\\nThe logic at the top selects the stack operation based on the 16-bit micro-instruction. 5 \\nBelow that are the three latches that hold the top of stack value.\\n(The large white squares look important, but they are simply \"jumpers\" from the ground line to the circuitry, passing\\nunder metal wires.) \\n The stack control circuitry. The blue regions on the right are oxide residue that remained when I dissolved the metal rail for the 5V power.\\n \\n The three-bit adder is at the bottom, along with the multiplexer.\\nYou might expect the adder to use a simple \"full adder\" circuit. Instead, it is\\na faster carry-lookahead adder.\\nI won\\'t go into details here, but the summary is that at each bit position, an AND gate produces a Carry Generate\\nsignal while an XOR gate produces a Carry Propagate signal.\\nLogic gates combine these signals to produce the output bits in parallel, avoiding the slowdown of the carry rippling\\nthrough the bits. \\n The incrementer/decrementer uses a completely different approach.\\nEach of the three bits uses a toggle flip-flop.\\nA few logic gates determine if each bit should be toggled or should keep its previous value.\\nFor instance, when incrementing, the top bit is toggled if the lower bits are 11 (e.g. incrementing from 011 to 100).\\nFor decrementing, the top bit is toggled if the lower bits are 00 (e.g. 100 to 011).\\nSimpler logic determines if the middle bit should be toggled.\\nThe bottom bit is easier, toggling every time whether incrementing or decrementing. \\n The schematic below shows the circuitry for one bit of the stack.\\nEach bit is implemented with a moderately complicated flip-flop that can be cleared, loaded with\\na value, or toggled, based on control signals from the microcode.\\nThe flip-flop is constructed from two set-reset (SR) latches. Note that the flip-flop outputs are crossed when fed back\\nto the input, providing the inversion for the toggle action.\\nAt the right, the multiplexer selects either the register value or the sum from the adder (not shown), generating the signals\\nto the decoder. \\n Schematic of one bit of the stack. \\n Drawbacks of the stack approach \\n According to the designers of the 8087, 7 \\nthe main motivation for using a stack rather than a flat register set was that instructions didn\\'t have enough bits to address multiple register operands.\\nIn addition, a stack has \"advantages over general registers for expression parsing and nested function calls.\"\\nThat is, a stack works well for a mathematical expression since sub-expressions can be evaluated on the top\\nof the stack.\\nAnd for function calls, you avoid the cost of saving registers to memory, since the subroutine can use the stack without disturbing the values underneath.\\nAt least that was the idea. \\n \\n\\n The main problem is \"stack overflow\".\\nThe 8087\\'s stack has eight entries, so if you push a ninth value onto the stack, the stack will overflow.\\nSpecifically, the top-of-stack pointer will wrap around, obliterating the bottom value on the stack.\\nThe 8087 is designed to detect a stack overflow using the register tags:\\npushing a value to a non-empty register triggers an invalid operation exception. 6 \\n The designers expected that stack overflow would be rare and could be handled by the operating system (or library code).\\nAfter detecting a stack overflow, the software should dump the existing stack to memory to\\nprovide the illusion of an infinite stack.\\nUnfortunately, bad design decisions made it difficult \"both technically and commercially\" to handle stack overflow. \\n One of the 8087\\'s designers (Kahan) attributes the 8087\\'s stack problems to the time difference between California,\\nwhere the designers lived, and Israel, where the 8087 was implemented.\\nDue to a lack of communication, each team thought the other was implementing the overflow software.\\nIt wasn\\'t until the\\n8087 was in production that they realized that \"it might not be possible to handle 8087 stack underflow/overflow in a reasonable way. It\\'s not impossible, just impossible to do it in a reasonable way.\" \\n As a result, the stack was largely a problem rather than a solution.\\nMost 8087 software saved the full stack to memory before performing\\na function call, creating more memory traffic.\\nMoreover, compilers turned out to work better with regular registers than a stack,\\nso compiler writers awkwardly used the stack to emulate regular registers.\\nThe GCC compiler reportedly needs 3000 lines of extra code to support the x87 stack. \\n In the 1990s, Intel introduced a new floating-point system called SSE , followed by AVX in 2011.\\nThese systems use regular (non-stack) registers and provide parallel operations for higher performance,\\nmaking the 8087\\'s stack instructions largely obsolete. \\n The success of the 8087 \\n At the start, Intel was unenthusiastic about producing the 8087, viewing it as unlikely to be a success.\\nJohn Palmar, a principal architect of the chip, had little success convincing\\nskeptical Intel management that the market for the 8087 was enormous.\\nEventually,\\nhe said, \"I\\'ll tell you what. I\\'ll relinquish my salary, provided you\\'ll write down your number of how many you expect to sell, then give me a dollar for every one you sell beyond that.\" 7 \\nIntel didn\\'t agree to the deal\u2014which would have made a fortune for Palmer\u2014but they reluctantly agreed to produce the chip. \\n Intel\\'s Santa Clara engineers shunned the 8087, considering it unlikely to work:\\nthe 8087 would be two to three times more complex than the 8086,\\nwith a die so large that a wafer might not have a single working die.\\nInstead, Rafi Nave, at Intel\\'s Israel site, took on the risky project: \u201cListen, everybody knows it\\'s not going to work, so if it won\\'t work, I would just fulfill their expectations or their assessment.\\nIf, by chance, it works, okay, then we\\'ll gain tremendous respect and tremendous breakthrough on our abilities.\u201d \\n A small team of seven engineers developed the 8087 in Israel.\\nThey designed the chip on Mylar sheets: a millimeter on Mylar represented a micron on the physical chip.\\nThe drawings were then digitized on a Calma system by clicking on each polygon to create the layout.\\nWhen the chip was moved into production,\\nthe yield was very low but better than feared: two working dies per four-inch wafer. \\n The 8087 ended up being a large success, said to have been Intel\\'s most profitable product line at times.\\nThe success of the 8087 (along with the 8088) cemented the reputation of Intel Israel, which eventually became Israel\\'s largest tech employer.\\nThe benefits of floating-point hardware proved to be so great that Intel integrated the floating-point unit into later processors\\nstarting with the 80486 (1989).\\nNowadays, most modern computers, from cellphones to mainframes, provide floating point based on the\\n8087,\\nso I consider the 8087 one of the most influential chips ever created. \\n For more, follow me on\\n Bluesky ( @righto.com ),\\nMastodon ( @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space ),\\nor RSS .\\nI wrote some articles about the 8087 a few years ago, including the die ,\\n the ROM ,\\nthe bit shifter ,\\nand the constants , so you may have seen some of this material before. \\n Notes and references \\n \\n \\n \\n Most computers now use the IEEE 754 floating-point standard,\\nwhich is based on the 8087.\\nThis standard has been awarded a\\n milestone in computation. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n Curiously, reliable sources differ on the number of transistors in the 8087 by almost a factor of 2.\\n  Intel says 40,000 , as does designer William Kahan ( link ).\\n  But in A Numeric Data Processor , designers Rafi Nave and John Palmer wrote that the chip contains \"the equivalent of over 65,000 devices\" (whatever \"equivalent\" means).\\n  This number is echoed by a contemporary article in Electronics (1980) that says \"over 65,000 H-MOS transistors on a 78,000-mil 2 die.\"\\n  Many other sources, such as Upgrading &amp; Repairing PCs , specify 45,000 transistors.\\n  Designer Rafi Nave stated that the 8087 has\\n  63,000 or 64,000 transistors if you count the ROM transistors directly, but if you count ROM transistors as\\n  equivalent to two transistors, then you get about 75,000 transistors. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The 8087 has a 16-bit Status Word that\\ncontains the stack top pointer, exception flags, the four-bit\\ncondition code, and other values.\\nAlthough the Status Word appears to be a 16-bit register, it is not implemented as a register.\\nInstead, parts of the Status Word are stored in various places around the chip: the stack top pointer is\\nin the stack circuitry, the exception flags are part of the interrupt circuitry, the condition code bits are\\nnext to the datapath, and so on.\\nWhen the Status Word is read or written, these various circuits are connected to the 8087\\'s internal data\\nbus, making the Status Word appear to be a monolithic entity.\\nThus, the stack circuitry includes support for reading and writing it. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n Intel filed several patents on the 8087, including Numeric data processor ,\\nanother Numeric data processor ,\\n Programmable bidirectional shifter ,\\n Fraction bus for use in a numeric data processor , and\\n System bus arbitration, circuitry and methodology . \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n I started looking at the stack in detail to reverse engineer the micro-instruction format and determine how the\\n8087\\'s microcode works.\\nI\\'m working with the \"Opcode Collective\" on Discord on this project, but progress is slow due to the complexity of\\nthe micro-instructions. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n The 8087 detects stack underflow in a similar manner.

I\\'m focusing\\non the red region in the lower right.\\nThese blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance.\\nThe dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the\\n\"routing channels\" that hold the wiring that connects the cells.\\nIn comparison,\\nfunctional blocks\\nsuch as the datapath on the left\\nand the microcode ROM in the lower right\\nwere designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance. \\n The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted. \\n As for other features on the chip,\\nthe black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip\\'s external pins.\\nThe chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern\\nstandards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286.\\n(Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer\\ncan hold vertical wires.)\\nThe metal appears white in larger areas, but\\npurplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface.\\nThe underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers. \\n The giant multiplexers \\n The standard cell circuitry that I\\'m examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers\\nwhile executing an instruction.\\nYou might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but\\ndue to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult.\\nOne problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX,\\nor two 8-bit registers AH and AL.\\nA second problem is that some instructions include a \"direction\" bit that switches the source and\\ndestination registers.\\nMoreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases,\\nthe register is specified by the microcode.\\nDue to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many\\ncases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources. \\n Three registers need to be selected for an operation\u2014two source registers and a destination register\u2014and there\\nare about 17 cases that need to be handled.\\nRegisters are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control\\nwhich part of the register is accessed.\\nWith three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that\\nthe register control logic is large and complicated.\\n(I wrote more about the 386\\'s registers here .) \\n I\\'m still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won\\'t go into details.\\nInstead, I\\'ll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells.\\nA multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple\\ninput signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs. 2 \\nA multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the\\ncorresponding control line, and then ORing the results together.\\nHowever, the 386 uses a different approach\u2014CMOS switches\u2014that avoids a large AND/OR gate. \\n Schematic of a CMOS switch. \\n The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors.\\nWhen the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are\\noff, the output is isolated.\\nAn NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its\\ninput is low . Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted.\\nThe motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output\\nlow, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance. 3 \\nUnlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch.\\nAs will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal. \\n The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope.\\nThis image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you\\ncan see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically.\\nThe bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal\\nwiring for a cell.\\nThe top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell.\\nThe large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections\\nbetween M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon.\\nThe central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green.\\nThe cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and\\n+5V rail that power the cells. \\nThe routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells. \\n Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch. \\n Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top.\\nThe doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines.\\nI\\'ve drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon.\\nThe metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple.\\nThe black dots are vias between layers.\\nNote how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within\\nthe cell.\\nAlthough this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once.\\nThe standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in\\ncolumns, snapped together like Lego bricks. \\n A diagram showing the silicon for a standard-cell switch. The polysilicon is shown in green. The bottom metal is shown in blue, red, and purple. \\n To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal.\\nThis switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify\\nthe signal.\\nThe data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so\\nthese connections can be made on either side.\\nAt the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter.\\nThe lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch.\\nA similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch.\\nHowever, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated. \\n A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input.\\nTurning on one switch will select the corresponding input.\\nFor instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs. \\n A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors. \\n The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs.\\nOne optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise,\\nif an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted.\\nOne set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input.\\nThe pink circuit selects 1,\\ngreen selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0.\\nThe multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs. \\n The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells.\\nThe green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control\\noutputs.\\nThe yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches.\\nThis diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random. \\n A block of standard-cell logic with multiplexers highlighted. The metal and polysilicon layers were removed for this photo, revealing the silicon transistors. \\n The misplaced transistor \\n The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns.\\nThe space between the cells is the \"routing channel\", holding the wiring that links the cells.\\nThe 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns\\nof cells. \\n The \"misplaced\" transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed. \\n I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools\\nassumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience. \\n The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer.\\nBut why is this transistor out of place?\\nMy hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix.\\nRegenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer.\\nPresumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the\\nrouting channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells. \\n The fake inverter \\n The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a\\nPMOS transistor to pull the output high.\\nThe standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various\\nsizes.\\n(Performance is improved by using inverters that aren\\'t too small but also aren\\'t\\nlarger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.) \\n The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope.\\nFor this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon\\n(bright green) and silicon (gray).\\nThe quality of this image is\\npoor\u2014it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon\u2014but the diagram below\\nshould clarify the circuit.\\nThe inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when\\nthe input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1.\\n(The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don\\'t function as well as NMOS transistors due to\\nsilicon physics.) \\n An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below. \\n The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is\\nformed.\\nTo make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter\\ncan be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input\\nis connected on the right and there is no connection on the left.\\nThe inverter\\'s output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it\\nis taken from the upper metal layer (not shown).\\nThe power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by\\nthe thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and\\nthe underlying silicon. \\n This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry.\\nHowever, I came across a few inverters that didn\\'t make sense. The problem was\\nthat the inverter\\'s output was connected to the output of a multiplexer.\\nSince an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer. 4 \\nThis didn\\'t make any sense.\\nI double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn\\'t messed up.\\nAfter more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a \"bad\" inverter didn\\'t make sense\\neither. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn\\'t work. \\n Finally, I realized what was going on. A \"bad inverter\" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter,\\nbut it wasn\\'t an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs.\\nNow it all made sense.\\nWith two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together.\\nAnd since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output\\nlow in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances,\\nor both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer\\'s output to be used undisturbed.\\nIn other words, the \"inverter\" was just two more cases for the multiplexer. \\n The \"bad\" inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.) \\n If you compare the \"bad inverter\" cell below with the previous cell, they look almost the same, but\\nthere are subtle differences.\\nFirst, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected\\nby a small gap in the transistor pair.\\nI\\'ve indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging\\nartifact, so I didn\\'t spot it.\\nThe second difference is that the \"fake\" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor,\\nwhile the inverter has a single input connection.\\nUnfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across\\nthe inverter without requiring an extra wire.\\nIn total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times\\nas independent transistors. \\n Conclusions \\n Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386,\\nback to the early 1970s, so this isn\\'t an Intel invention. 5 \\nNonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it\\nwas a risky decision.\\nThey needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn\\'t a trivial undertaking.\\nThis choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule.\\nThe 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer\\narchitecture for the rest of the 20th century. \\n If you\\'re interested in standard cell logic, I also wrote about standard cell logic in an IBM chip .\\nI plan to write more about the 386, so \\nfollow me on\\n Mastodon , Bluesky ,\\nor RSS for updates.\\nThanks to Pat Gelsinger and Roxanne Koester for providing helpful papers. \\n For more on the 386 and other chips, follow me on\\nMastodon ( @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space ),\\nBluesky ( @righto.com ),\\nor RSS .  (I\\'ve given up on Twitter.)\\nIf you want to read more about the 386, I\\'ve written about the clock pin ,\\n prefetch queue , die versions , packaging , and I/O circuits . \\n Notes and references \\n \\n \\n \\n The decision to use automatic place and route is described on page 13 of the Intel 386 Microprocessor Design and Development Oral History Panel , a very interesting document on the 386 with discussion from\\nsome of the people involved in its development. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n Multiplexers often take a binary control signal to select the desired input.\\nFor instance, an 8-to-1 multiplexer selects one of 8 inputs, so a 3-bit control signal\\ncan specify the desired input.\\nThe 386\\'s multiplexers use a different approach with one control signal per input.\\nOne of the 8 control signals is activated to select the desired input.\\nThis approach is called a \"one-hot encoding\" since one control line is activated (hot)\\nat a time. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n Some chips, such as the MOS Technology 6502 processor, are built with NMOS technology, without PMOS transistors.\\nMultiplexers in the 6502 use a single NMOS transistor, rather than the two transistors in the CMOS switch.\\nHowever, the performance of the switch is worse. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n One very common circuit in the 386 is a latch constructed from an inverter loop and a switch/multiplexer.\\nThe inverter\\'s output and the switch\\'s output are connected together.\\nThe trick, however, is that the inverter is constructed from special weak transistors.\\nWhen the switch is disabled, the inverter\\'s weak output is sufficient to drive the loop.\\nBut to write a value into the latch, the switch is enabled and its output overpowers the weak\\ninverter. \\n The point of this is that there are circuits where an inverter and a multiplexer have their\\noutputs connected. However, the inverter must be constructed with special weak transistors, which is not the situation\\nthat I\\'m discussing. \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n I\\'ll provide more history on standard cells in this footnote.\\n RCA patented a bipolar standard cell in 1971,\\n but this was a fixed arrangement of transistors and resistors, more of a gate array than a modern\\n standard cell.\\n Bell Labs researched standard cell layout techniques in the early 1970s, calling them Polycells, including\\n a 1973 paper by Brian Kernighan.\\n By 1979, A Guide to LSI Implementation discussed the standard cell approach and\\n it was described as well-known in this patent application .\\n Even so, Electronics called these design methods \"futuristic\" in 1980. \\n Standard cells became popular in the mid-1980s as faster computers and improved design software made\\n it practical to produce semi-custom designs that used standard cells.\\n Standard cells made it to the cover of Digital Design in August 1985, and the article inside described numerous vendors and products.\\n Companies like Zymos and VLSI Technology (VTI) focused on standard cells.\\n Traditional companies such as Texas Instruments , NCR, GE/RCA, Fairchild , Harris, ITT , and Thomson introduced lines of standard cell products in\\n the mid-1980s.\\n \\n \u21a9 \\n \\n \\n '}</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 12:51:49</p>"},{"location":"seangoedecke.com/","title":"seangoedecke.com","text":"<p>\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>How does AI impact skill formation- 20260131</li> </ul> <p>\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u7531 OpenClaw \u81ea\u52a8\u6293\u53d6</p>"},{"location":"seangoedecke.com/How%20does%20AI%20impact%20skill%20formation-_20260131/","title":"How does AI impact skill formation?","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: seangoedecke.com \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT \u94fe\u63a5: https://seangoedecke.com/how-does-ai-impact-skill-formation/</p> <p>{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml', 'value': '<p>Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called How AI Impacts Skill Formation. Like other papers on AI before it, this one is being treated as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?</p>\\n<p>The structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study Your Brain on ChatGPT. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.</p>\\n<p>The banner result was that AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don\u2019t think that conclusion is reasonable.</p>\\nRetyping AI-generated code\\n<p>To see why, let\u2019s look at Figure 13 from the paper:</p>\\n<p>\\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    </p>\\n<p>The researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time literally retyping the AI-generated code into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or \u201cmanual coding\u201d: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.</p>\\n<p>I confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers<sup>1</sup>)? It certainly didn\u2019t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.</p>\\n<p>In any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn\u2019t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up. </p>\\nWhat about the quiz scores?\\n<p>Even if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?</p>\\n<p>Well, first we should note that the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.</p>\\n<p>But of course much current AI use is not like this: if you\u2019re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you\u2019re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?</p>\\n<p>Well yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you\u2019d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it\u2019s pretty silly to deny this: it\u2019s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.</p>\\n<p>Still, I have two points to make about this.</p>\\nSoftware engineers are paid to ship, not to learn\\n<p>First, software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you\u2019re learning more efficiently. That\u2019s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn\u2019t make it false.</p>\\n<p>Other professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don\u2019t atrophy.</p>\\nMoving faster gives you more opportunities to learn\\n<p>The other point I wanted to make is that even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you\u2019re learning less overall depends on how many more tasks you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.</p>\\n<p>I don\u2019t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they\u2019ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.</p>\\nWe need to talk about GPT-4o\\n<p>Finally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I\u2019m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of \u201cwell, you just haven\u2019t tried the right model\u201d. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.</p>\\n<p>Still, I\u2019m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted in 2025<sup>2</sup>, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that\u2019s like five years in AI time). I can\u2019t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.</p>\\nSummary\\n<p>I don\u2019t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure \u201cjust give the problem to the model\u201d AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.</p>\\n<p>I don\u2019t like their conclusion that AI use doesn\u2019t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time literally retyping AI code. I wish they\u2019d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don\u2019t really blame them for the result - I\u2019m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.</p>\\n<p>Overall, I don\u2019t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn\u2019t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing \u201cbuild me a todo app\u201d into Claude Code means you\u2019ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.</p>\\n<p>That said, I\u2019d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It\u2019s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it\u2019s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.</p>\\n<p>edit: the popular tech youtuber Theo cited this post as a source for his video on this paper.

It's actually unrelated to Deno itself - this is part of their Deno Deploy SaaS platform. As such, you don't even need to use JavaScript to access it - you can create and execute code in a hosted sandbox using their deno-sandbox Python library like this:</p> <pre>export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN=\"... API token ...\"\nuv run --with deno-sandbox python</pre> <p>Then:</p> <pre>from deno_sandbox import DenoDeploy\n\nsdk = DenoDeploy()\n\nwith sdk.sandbox.create() as sb:\n    # Run a shell command\n    process = sb.spawn(\n        \"echo\", args=[\"Hello from the sandbox!\"]\n    )\n    process.wait()\n    # Write and read files\n    sb.fs.write_text_file(\n        \"/tmp/example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\"\n    )\n    print(sb.fs.read_text_file(\n        \"/tmp/example.txt\"\n    ))</pre> <p>There\u2019s a JavaScript client library as well. The underlying API isn\u2019t documented yet but appears to use WebSockets.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot to like about this system. Sandboxe instances can have up to 4GB of RAM, get 2 vCPUs, 10GB of ephemeral storage, can mount persistent volumes and can use snapshots to boot pre-configured custom images quickly. Sessions can last up to 30 minutes and are billed by CPU time, GB-h of memory and volume storage usage.</p> <p>When you create a sandbox you can configure network domains it\u2019s allowed to access.</p> <p>My favorite feature is the way it handles API secrets.</p> <pre>with sdk.sandboxes.create(\n    allowNet=[\"api.openai.com\"],\n    secrets={\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": {\n            \"hosts\": [\"api.openai.com\"],\n            \"value\": os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n        }\n    },\n) as sandbox:\n    # ... $OPENAI_API_KEY is available</pre> <p>Within the container that <code>$OPENAI_API_KEY</code> value is set to something like this:</p> <pre><code>DENO_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_b14043a2f578cba...\n</code></pre> <p>Outbound API calls to <code>api.openai.com</code> run through a proxy which is aware of those placeholders and replaces them with the original secret.</p> <p>In this way the secret itself is not available to code within the sandbox, which limits the ability for malicious code (e.g. from a prompt injection) to exfiltrate those secrets.</p> <p>From a comment on Hacker News I learned that Fly have a project called tokenizer that implements the same pattern.

Instead of 100s of programs operating with separate budgets, across different Program Executive Offices, the intent of the Portfolio Acquisition Executives is to consolidate overlapping programs, eliminate the redundant ones, pick winners, kill losers, get rid of processes that kill speed, and focus on rapid deployment.</p>\\n<p>What\u2019s Missing?\\nOrganizing by Portfolio Acquisition Executives is a great start, but simply consolidating the parts of the defense Acquisition system that were broken under one umbrella organization won\u2019t make it better. Making bad ideas go faster should not be the goal. However, we\u2019re at risk of doing just that. (Pete Newell at BMNT has been reminding me of this for years.)</p>\\n<p>For example, many of these new Portfolio executives are managing their programs by holding monthly reviews of proposed investments and current portfolio performance (just like private investors.) Here they\u2019ll decide which programs get funded, which get more funding, and which should stop. (Actually having a regular process to kill programs early is sorely needed.) These are great ideas. However, if the meetings start by reviewing progress of prototypes to show that the technology works or that warfighters want it, and funds progress on those metrics, it misses the changes needed in an effective acquisition system.</p>\\n<p>The result will be building a faster version of a weapons requirements process that starts with a top-down list of features, or worse, shiny tech products (e.g. \u201cI need drones.\u201d) This \u201crequirements first\u201d process is what will drive the \u201cbad ideas faster\u201d problem.</p>\\n<p>A more productive approach \u2013 one that delivers truly decisive capabilities \u2013 would be to build a different process upfront \u2013 a rigorous problem identification and validation phase on the front-end of every acquisition program.</p>\\n<p>This process would start with a wide funnel of problems, ideas, technology, each with a 10-line problem summary that describes the\\xa0 specific challenge to address; why it can\u2019t be solved currently; what it will take to solve it; and how a solution will be funded and deployed in the field.</p>\\n<p>The goal would be to 1) consolidate problems that may be different descriptions of the same core problem, and/or 2) discover if the problems are a symptom of something more complex.</p>\\n<p>Then each problem would go through an iterative process of problem and technical discovery. This will help define what a minimum deployable product and its minimum constraints (security, policy, reliability) should be, such as how long the solution would take to deploy, the source of funding for scale and who needs to buy-in.</p>\\n<p>This exercise will keep the focus where it needs to be \u2014 not on reforming a system but on delivering things to warfighters with speed and urgency so we can actually deter or win a war.</p>\\n<p>Want to Keep Up With the Changes in the DoW?</p>\\n<p>Get the free 2026 DoW Directory.</p>\\n<p>Both a startup \u201cgo-to-market\u201d guide and the first ever Directory of the Department of War.

It's very easy for folks to judge law enforcement solely on what they see from the outside, and that's mostly going after offenders and taking down criminal infrastructure. But the bit I'm increasingly seeing behind the scenes is a push to help kids (the sorts of hackers I usually interact with are teenagers or young adults at most) make better choices when they're faced with a pathway into cybercrime. The transition from minor offences (game cheats and DDoS'ing) to full-on cybercriminals (hacking and extortion) is very well-known, and intervening at the right time can not only make a difference to the impact of data breaches on all of us, but it can also make a massive difference to these kids' lives.

You probably haven't met him. He's quite particular about guests.</p> <p>This beaver builds dams. That's what beavers do. But this beaver kept building dams that... well\u2026</p> <p>One collapsed in spring. One leaked from seventeen places at once. One was structurally perfect but faced the wrong direction and created a pond in someone else's forest, which caused a whole thing with the elk, and\u2026 honestly\u2026 it's probably best not to get into it.</p> <p>The beaver was frustrated. He knew how to build dams. He'd read all the dam literature. But knowing and doing kept arriving at different addresses.</p> <p>Then he found the Oracle.</p> <p>Deep in the forest there's an old stump with a hollow inside, and in the hollow lives something that knows things. The beaver doesn't know what it is. Neither do I. It speaks in a voice like wind through telephone wires, if telephone wires grew in forests, which they don't, but\u2026 whatever\u2026 just roll with it\u2026</p> <p>The beaver asked the Oracle: \"Build me a dam.\"</p> <p>The Oracle hummed. Considered. Built something.</p> <p>It was made of fish.</p> <p>\"That's not a dam,\" said the beaver.</p> <p>\"You didn't say no fish,\" said the Oracle.</p> <p>The beaver tried again. But this time, before asking for a dam, he asked:</p> <p>\"What makes a dam good?\"</p> <p>The Oracle thought about this for a long time. Or maybe no time at all. Time is weird in stumps.</p> <p>Then he asked for the dam.</p> <p>This is Deductive Prompting, which is a fancy way of saying: make the Oracle say what good is, out loud, before you make it do good.</p> <p>The Oracle knows things. But it forgets to check if it's using what it knows. When you make it speak the principles first, they're right there, in its head, fresh. It builds against them. It measures twice.</p> <p>The beaver understood this intuitively. Beavers always measure twice. It's a whole thing with us.</p> <p>But sometimes the beaver is in a hurry.</p> <p>He doesn't have time to ask the Oracle to philosophize about dams. He's seen good dams. He knows what they look like. He just needs another one, quick, before the rain comes.</p> <p>So he shows the Oracle three dams. Doesn't explain anything. Doesn't ask why they work. Just points.</p> <p>Inductive Prompting. Examples \u2192 (implicit pattern) \u2192 new instance.</p> <p>This is classic few-shot prompting, but viewed through a \"think before you build\" lens.</p> <p>The pattern stays inside the Oracle's head. You never see it. You never audit it. You just... trust. Trust that the Oracle looked at your three dams and understood what you meant by \"like these.\"</p> <p>This is the fastest technique. Also the one that requires the most faith.</p> <p>The beaver uses it when he's in a hurry, when the stakes are low, when the pattern is easier to show than to explain. When he just needs a dam and doesn't need to understand why it's a good dam.</p> <p>The risk? The Oracle might induce a different pattern than the one you intended. You're looking at your examples thinking \"ah yes, the load distribution\" and the Oracle is looking at them thinking \"ah yes, they all face north.\"</p> <p>And then you get a north-facing dam in a south-facing watershed, and the elk are back, and... well...</p> <p>\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4: 2026-02-05 12:44:48</p>"},{"location":"xania.org/","title":"xania.org","text":"<p>\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6587\u7ae0\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>2025 in Review</li> <li>Clever memory tricks</li> <li>Switching it up a bit</li> <li>Thank you</li> <li>When compilers surprise you</li> </ul> <p>\u672c\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u7531 OpenClaw \u81ea\u52a8\u6293\u53d6</p>"},{"location":"xania.org/2025%20in%20Review/","title":"2025 in Review","text":"<p>\u6765\u6e90: xania.org \u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4: \u94fe\u63a5: http://xania.org/202512/2025-in-review?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss</p> <p>{'type': 'application/xhtml+xml', 'language': 'en-GB', 'base': 'https://xania.org/feed', 'value': '<p>Written by me, proof-read by an LLM.\\nDetails at end.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>2025 has been quite a year for me.

String comparisons seem straightforward enough - check the length, compare the bytes, done. But watch what Clang does when comparing against compile-time constants, and you\\'ll see some rather clever tricks involving overlapping memory reads and bitwise operations. What looks like it should be a call to <code>memcmp</code> becomes a handful of inline instructions that exploit the fact that the comparison value is known at compile time<sup>1</sup>.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'ve set up nine functions that each compare a <code>std::string_view</code> against a constant string of increasing length, from one to nine characters. This gives us a chance to see how the compiler\\'s approach changes based on the length of the comparison.</p>\\n\\n<p>As we learned when looking at calling conventions, a <code>std::string_view</code> is a pointer and a length, passed in two registers on x86 Linux. Each of these functions receives a <code>std::size_t</code> length in <code>rdi</code> and a <code>const char *</code> pointer in <code>rsi</code><sup>2</sup>. One might reasonably expect a call to <code>memcmp</code>, but the compiler has both inlined and specialised the comparison for each constant string. Let\\'s take a look at some of these comparison functions, starting with <code>t1</code>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>t1:\\n  cmp rdi, 1                ; is length 1?\\n  jne .LBB0_1               ; if not 1, goto \"return false\"\\n  cmp byte ptr [rsi], 65    ; is the byte 65 (\\'A\\')?\\n  sete al                   ; set result to 0 or 1 accordingly\\n  ret                       ; return\\n.LBB0_1:\\n  xor eax, eax              ; set result to false\\n  ret                       ; return\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>We see the length is checked first, and if it\\'s not 1, then we return. Otherwise, we check the one character to see if it\\'s <code>A</code> or not, and then set the return value accordingly. The compiler has used a conditional set <code>sete</code> instruction to avoid a second branch.</p>\\n\\n<p>The pattern holds for power-of-two sizes: Looking at <code>t2</code>, <code>t4</code> and <code>t8</code> we see that the compiler does the same length check, and then cleverly realises it can compare a 2, 4 or 8-byte value directly with a constant of either <code>AB</code>, <code>ABCD</code> or <code>ABCDEFGH</code> (mouse over the constants in the view to see Compiler Explorer interpret them as ASCII).</p>\\n\\n<p>Things get more interesting with the 7 character case, <code>t7</code>:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>t7:\\n  cmp rdi, 7                    ; is length 7?\\n  jne .LBB6_1                   ; if not, goto \"return false\"\\n  mov eax, 1145258561           ; set eax to \"ABCD\"\\n  xor eax, dword ptr [rsi]      ; eax ^= first four chars of sv\\n  mov ecx, 1195787588           ; set ecx to \"DEFG\"\\n  xor ecx, dword ptr [rsi + 3]  ; ecx ^= chars 3,4,5,6 of sv\\n  or ecx, eax                   ; ecx |= eax\\n  sete al                       ; result = 1 if \"zero flag\" else 0\\n  ret                           ; return\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>The check for the length is the same as the other cases, but once we know we\\'re going to be comparing 7 bytes, some cunning tricks come into play. First, the compiler isn\\'t directly comparing, as you might expect: It uses the fact that XORing identical values will result in a zero. Secondly, it has used two overlapping reads - reading bytes 0,1,2,3 and then 3,4,5,6. The redundant read of byte 3 doesn\\'t matter, but doing two 32-bit reads is cheaper than having to read individual bytes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once the two XORs have happened, we have \"zero only if first four bytes match ABCD\" in <code>eax</code> and \"zero only if bytes 3,4,5,6 match DEFG\" in <code>ecx</code>. Simply logical-ORing the two together gives us zero if and only if both were zero - only if all bytes matched. Then a simple <code>sete</code> turns the \"zero flag\" into either 0 or 1 for the <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> return value needed. Cute!</p>\\n\\n<p>This optimisation works well on x86 as reading unaligned 32-bit values is free.

And they do - when the compiler can\\'t find something cleverer to do instead.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s start with a really simple example:</p>\\n\\n<p>Here the compiler has spotted the relationship between <code>x</code> and the return value, and rewritten the code as: <code>if (x &lt; 5) return (x+1) * 100; else return 0;</code> - pretty neat. No jump table, just maths!</p>\\n\\n<p>If we mix up the code a bit so there\\'s no obvious relationship between the input and the return value:</p>\\n\\n<p>Still no jump table: Now the compiler has built a bespoke lookup table (<code>CSWTCH.1</code>) and then uses <code>x</code> to index into it (after checking it\\'s in bounds).</p>\\n\\n<p>For \"dense\" case statements, like the ones above, the compiler can be smart. But even with relatively sparse inputs, the compiler can work its magic. Consider this \"is it whitespace?\" routine<sup>1</sup>:</p>\\n\\n<p>That still avoids any kind of jump table; and in fact even avoids a branch:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>is_whitespace(char):\\n  sub edi, 9            ; edi = x - 9 (<code>\\\\t</code>)\\n  mov eax, 8388631      ; eax = 0b100000000000000000010111\\n  bt rax, rdi           ; test bit edi in the eax bitmask\\n  setc al               ; al = (bit was set) ? 1 : 0\\n  xor edx, edx          ; edx = 0\\n  cmp dil, 24           ; compare edi with 24\\n  cmovnb eax, edx       ; replace al with edx (0) if not below\\n  ret                   ; return\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>The compiler has built a bitmask where each bit says \"should we consider this character to be whitespace\". To fit the range of bits needed to cover all the whitespace characters, the compiler indexes into the bitmask with <code>(x - 9)</code>. The bit test instruction (<code>bt</code>) will test any bit position, but our 32-bit bitmask only has meaningful data in positions 0-31. The compiler checks that <code>(x - 9) &lt;= 24</code> to ensure we\\'re within the valid range <sup>2</sup> of the bitmask (covering tab at position 0 through space at position 23), and replaces the result with 0 for anything outside this range.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just to see what else the compiler can generate, let\\'s take a look at both a dense and sparse example that the compiler can\\'t replace with a table (you\\'ll need to scroll around in the Compiler Explorer panes to see more):</p>\\n\\n<p>For the dense case, the compiler does make a jump table, and indexes by <code>x</code> to jump to the right <code>func</code> routine<sup>3</sup>. For the sparse case, the compiler has to fall back to essentially a set of <code>if()</code> statements, comparing and branching. However, it\\'s clever enough to compare a \"mid-range\" value first (<code>2511</code>), and if the <code>x</code> value is greater, jumps to code that only looks at the <code>5284</code> and <code>4865</code>. So it\\'s essentially a binary serarch tree of comparisons.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different compilers employ quite different tricks, so take some time to see what clang does for all the above examples.</p>\\n\\n<p>Write clear switch statements; let the compiler decide whether that means multiplication, bitmasks, or jump tables.

When I first saw this optimisation I could hardly believe it. I was looking at loop optimisation, and wrote something like this simple function that sums all the numbers up to a given value:</p>\\n\\n<p>So far so decent: GCC has done some preliminary checks, then fallen into a loop that efficiently sums numbers using <code>lea</code> (we\\'ve seen this before). But taking a closer look at the loop we see something unusual:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>.L3:\\n  lea edx, [rdx+1+rax2]        ; result = result + 1 + x2\\n  add eax, 2                    ; x += 2\\n  cmp edi, eax                  ; x != value\\n  jne .L3                       ; keep looping\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The compiler has cleverly realised it can do two numbers<sup>1</sup> at a time using the fact it can see we\\'re going to add <code>x</code> and <code>x + 1</code>, which is the same as adding <code>x*2 + 1</code>. Very cunning, I think you\\'ll agree!</p>\\n\\n<p>If you turn the optimiser up to <code>-O3</code> you\\'ll see the compiler works even harder to vectorise the loop using parallel adds. All very clever.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is all for GCC. Let\\'s see what clang does with our code:</p>\\n\\n<p>This is where I nearly fell off my chair: there is no loop! Clang checks for positive <code>value</code>, and if so it does:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>  lea eax, [rdi - 1]        ; eax = value - 1\\n  lea ecx, [rdi - 2]        ; ecx = value - 2\\n  imul rcx, rax             ; rcx = (value - 1) * (value - 2)\\n  shr rcx                   ; rcx &gt;&gt;= 1\\n  lea eax, [rdi + rcx]      ; eax = value + rcx\\n  dec eax                   ; --eax\\n  ret\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>It was not at all obvious to me what on earth was going on here. By backing out the maths a little, this is equivalent to:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>v + ((v - 1)(v - 2) / 2) - 1;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>Expanding the parentheses:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>v + (v\u00b2 - 2v - v + 2) / 2 - 1\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>Rearranging a bit:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>(v\u00b2 - 3v + 2) / 2 + (v - 1)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>Multiplying the <code>(v - 1)</code> by 2 / 2:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>(v\u00b2 - 3v + 2) / 2 + (2v - 2)/2\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>Combining those and cancelling:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>(v\u00b2 - v) / 2\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>Simplifying and factoring gives us <code>v(v - 1) / 2</code> which is the closed-form solution to the \"sum of integers\"! Truly amazing<sup>2</sup> - we\\'ve gone from an O(n) algorithm as written, to an O(1) one!</p>\\n\\n<p>I love that despite working with compilers for more than twenty years, they can still surprise and delight me. The years of experience and work that have been poured into making compilers great is truly humbling, and inspiring.</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\'re nearly at the end of this series - there\\'s so much more to say but that will have to wait for another time.
