{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<img alt="Book cover featuring a scorpion." class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66629" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/examiner.webp" width="200" />\n\n<p>I\'ve thoroughly enjoyed all of <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/tag/janice-hallett/">Janice Hallett\'s previous crime books</a>. The Examiner is, frankly, more of the same - and I\'m happy with that!</p>\n\n<p>You, the reader, are given a series of transcripts and have to work out what crime (if any) has been committed. You don\'t find out who the victim(s) is/are until reasonably far through the story. The characters are well realised (although a little similar to some of her others). The twists are shockingly good and will make you flick back to see if you could have spotted them.</p>\n\n<p>Hallett is <em>exquisite</em> at building tension through the slow drip-drip-drip of reveals. OK, so the transcripts are a bit unrealistic but they make a good scaffold. While it might be nice to include user avatars on the WhatsApp messages, the characters\' voices are unique enough to distinguish them easily.</p>\n\n<p>Much like <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/book-review-the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-by-janice-hallett/">The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</a>, the book plays around with symbolism and the nature of faith. You may find yourself sympathising with the characters and then quickly recanting!</p>\n\n<h2 id="technical-issues"><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/book-review-the-examiner-janice-hallett/#technical-issues">Technical Issues</a></h2>\n\n<p>Viper, the publisher, seem to have messed up the structure of this eBook. Despite being published in 2024, they\'re using an <em>ancient</em> and obsolete version of the <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz/">Blitz ePub CSS</a> which itself was archived back in 2020. As well as strange indents, there\'s a hard-coded 2em margin only on the right.</p>\n\n<p>Accessibility is poor. All the abbreviations use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element. But some kind of automated find-and-replace has mangled most of them. For example, the "Masters degree in Multimedia Art (Full-Time Programme)" is shortened to "MMAM(FTP)" and then given the nonsensical abbreviation of "Molecular Area Per Molecule (File Transfer Protocol)"!</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/how-long-does-it-take-to-upgrade-an-ebook/">Much like before</a> I\'ve written to them asking them to correct it.</p>'}
