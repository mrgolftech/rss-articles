Some really good and unconventional tips in here for getting to a place with coding agents where they demonstrably improve your workflow and productivity. I particularly liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey#step-2-reproduce-your-own-work">Reproduce your own work</a> - when learning to use coding agents Mitchell went through a period of doing the work manually, then recreating the same solution using agents as an exercise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually, and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey#step-3-end-of-day-agents">End-of-day agents</a> - letting agents step in when your energy runs out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To try to find some efficiency, I next started up a new pattern: <strong>block out the last 30 minutes of every day to kick off one or more agents.</strong> My hypothesis was that <em>perhaps</em> I could gain some efficiency if the agent can make some <em>positive progress</em> in the times I can't work anyways.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey#step-4-outsource-the-slam-dunks">Outsource the Slam Dunks</a> - once you know an agent can likely handle a task, have it do that task while you work on something more interesting yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
