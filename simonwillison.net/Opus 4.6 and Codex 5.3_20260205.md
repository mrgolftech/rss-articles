<p>Two major new model releases today, within about 15 minutes of each other.</p>
<p>Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6">released Opus 4.6</a>. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a6806ce41b4c721e240a4548ecdbe216">its pelican</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Slightly wonky bicycle frame but an excellent pelican, very clear beak and pouch, nice feathers." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/opus-4.6-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/">release GPT-5.3-Codex</a>, albeit only via their Codex app, not yet in their API. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/bfc4a83f588ac762c773679c0d1e034b">its pelican</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Not nearly as good - the bicycle is a bit mangled, the pelican not nearly as well rendered - it's more of a line drawing." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codex-5.3-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>I've had a bit of preview access to both of these models and to be honest I'm finding it hard to find a good angle to write about them - they're both <em>really good</em>, but so were their predecessors Codex 5.2 and Opus 4.5. I've been having trouble finding tasks that those previous models couldn't handle but the new ones are able to ace.</p>
<p>The most convincing story about capabilities of the new model so far is Nicholas Carlini from Anthropic talking about Opus 4.6 and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler">Building a C compiler with a team of parallel Claudes</a> - Anthropic's version of Cursor's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/23/fastrender/">FastRender project</a>.</p>
