    "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral-transcribe-2\">Voxtral transcribes at the speed of sound</a></strong></p>\nMistral just released Voxtral Transcribe 2 - a family of two new models, one open weights, for transcribing audio to text. This is the latest in their Whisper-like model family, and a sequel to the original Voxtral which they released <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/16/voxtral/\">in July 2025</a>.</p>\n<p>Voxtral Realtime - official name <code>Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602</code> - is the open weights (Apache-2.0) model, available as a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602\">8.87GB download from Hugging Face</a>.</p>\n<p>You can try it out in this <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-Realtime\">live demo</a> - don't be put off by the \"No microphone found\" message, clicking \"Record\" should have your browser request permission and then start the demo working. I was very impressed by the demo - I talked quickly and used jargon like Django and WebAssembly and it correctly transcribed my text within moments of me uttering each sound. </p>\n<p>The closed weight model is called <code>voxtral-mini-latest</code> and can be accessed via the Mistral API, using calls that look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl -X POST <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>https://api.mistral.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -H <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Authorization: Bearer <span class=\"pl-smi\">$MISTRAL_API_KEY</span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F model=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>voxtral-mini-latest<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F file=@<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Pelican talk at the library.m4a<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F diarize=true \\\n  -F context_bias=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Datasette<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F timestamp_granularities=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>segment<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n\n<p>The Mistral API console now has a <a href=\"https://console.mistral.ai/build/audio/speech-to-text\">speech-to-text playground</a> for exercising the new model and it is <em>excellent</em>. You can upload an audio file and promptly get a diarized transcript in a pleasant interface, with options to download the result in text, SRT or JSON format.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a speech-to-text transcription interface for a file named &quot;Pelican talk at the library.m4a&quot;. The toolbar shows &quot;Speech to text&quot; with Code, Transcribe, and Download buttons. The transcript shows timestamped segments from 5:53 to 6:53 with a speaker icon, reading: &quot;5:53 – 6:01 So pelicans love to, they're very good at getting the most they can out of the topography when they're flying. 6:01 – 6:06 And our winds come in from the northwest and they hit those bluffs and they're deflected up. 6:07 – 6:18 And they will sit right, they'll fly north into a wind like five feet off those bluffs, but just five or ten feet off the surface because the winds dissipate. 6:19 – 6:22 And they will surf that bluff all the way north. 6:23 – 6:30 So you'll see a wind from the north at 15 miles an hour, and the pelicans are flying north into that wind and not flapping their wings. 6:31 – 6:33 And it's one of the coolest things. 6:33 – 6:35 You can only find it on San Francisco Coast. 6:36 – 6:39 Where right where the bluffs are steep. 6:41 – 6:43 Pacifica, you can find them there. 6:43 – 6:51 They like their, what we call pier bums, which are typically pelicans that have, are in some sort of trouble. 6:51 – 6:53 They're unable to catch food.&quot; The segment at 6:41–6:43 is highlighted in yellow.

    "summary": "Today's links Justin Key's \"The Hospital at the End Of the World\": A biopunk medical thriller from a major new talent. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Coconut volunteers; Astro Noise; Rich old men behind \"Millennials Rising\"; Stop the \"Stop the Steal\" steal; \"Chasing Shadows.\" Upcoming appearances: Where to find me.

Justin Key's \"The Hospital at the End Of the World\" (permalink) Justin C. Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, The Hospital at the End of the World: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866 I've followed Key's work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me &#8211; a standout writer in a year full of standouts &#8211; and I wasn't surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, The World Wasn't Ready For You, in 2023: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015 This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don't publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven't already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they're names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll But anyone who read World Wasn't Ready immediately understood why Key's work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops. Hospital at the End of the World is Key's first novel, and it's terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, Hospital follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok's father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings. The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from every medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That's when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father. To make things worse, Pok's father has fallen grievously ill &#8211; so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn't accompany his father, though &#8211; he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok's apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization. Thus begins Pok's tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America's AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok's father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization's rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine. Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people. This is the book's second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth. What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key's own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It's one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care. It's a well-structured, well-paced sf novel that probes big, urgent contemporary themes while still engrossing the reader in the intimate human relations of its principals.

    "title": "Distributing Go binaries like sqlite-scanner through PyPI using go-to-wheel",
    "link": "https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/#atom-everything",
    "summary": "<p>I've been exploring Go for building small, fast and self-contained binary applications recently. I'm enjoying how there's generally one obvious way to do things and the resulting code is boring and readable - and something that LLMs are very competent at writing. The one catch is distribution, but it turns out publishing Go binaries to PyPI means any Go binary can be just a <code>uvx package-name</code> call away.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</a> is my new Go CLI tool for scanning a filesystem for SQLite database files.</p>\n<p>It works by checking if the first 16 bytes of the file exactly match the SQLite magic number sequence <code>SQLite format 3\\x00</code>. It can search one or more folders recursively, spinning up concurrent goroutines to accelerate the scan. It streams out results as it finds them in plain text, JSON or newline-delimited JSON. It can optionally display the file sizes as well.</p>\n<p>To try it out you can download a release from the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner/releases\">GitHub releases</a> - and then <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445\">jump through macOS hoops</a> to execute an \"unsafe\" binary. Or you can clone the repo and compile it with Go. Or... you can run the binary like this:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default this will search your current directory for SQLite databases. You can pass one or more directories as arguments:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner ~ /tmp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add <code>--json</code> for JSON output, <code>--size</code> to include file sizes or <code>--jsonl</code> for newline-delimited JSON.

It means that any functionality which is available in a cross-platform Go binary can now be subsumed into a Python package. Python is really good at running subprocesses so this opens up a whole world of useful tricks that we can bake into our Python tools.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate this, I built <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan\">datasette-scan</a> - a new Datasette plugin which depends on <code>sqlite-scanner</code> and then uses that Go binary to scan a folder for SQLite databases and attach them to a Datasette instance.</p>\n<p>Here's how to use that (without even installing anything first, thanks <code>uv</code>) to explore any SQLite databases in your Downloads folder:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with datasette-scan datasette scan <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/Downloads</pre></div>\n<p>If you peek at the code you'll see it <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/pyproject.toml#L14\">depends on sqlite-scanner</a> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and calls it using <code>subprocess.run()</code> against <code>sqlite_scanner.get_binary_path()</code> in its own <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/datasette_scan/__init__.py#L38-L58\">scan_directories() function</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been exploring this pattern for other, non-Go binaries recently - here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/livestream-gif.py\">a recent script</a> that depends on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/static-ffmpeg/\">static-ffmpeg</a> to ensure that <code>ffmpeg</code> is available for the script to use.</p>\n<h4 id=\"building-python-wheels-from-go-packages-with-go-to-wheel\">Building Python wheels from Go packages with go-to-wheel</h4>\n<p>After trying this pattern myself a couple of times I realized it would be useful to have a tool to automate the process.</p>\n<p>I first <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/2d9ced56-b3e8-4651-83cc-860b9b419187\">brainstormed with Claude</a> to check that there was no existing tool to do this. It pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.maturin.rs/bindings.html#bin\">maturin bin</a> which helps distribute Rust projects using Python wheels, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Bing-su/pip-binary-factory\">pip-binary-factory</a> which bundles all sorts of other projects, but did not identify anything that addressed the exact problem I was looking to solve.</p>\n<p>So I <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?41f04e4eb823b1ceb888d9a28c2280dd/index.html\">had Claude Code for web build the first version</a>, then refined the code locally on my laptop with the help of more Claude Code and a little bit of OpenAI Codex too, just to mix things up.</p>\n<p>The full documentation is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">simonw/go-to-wheel</a> repository. I've published that tool to PyPI so now you can run it using:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel --help</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>sqlite-scanner</code> package you can <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/\">see on PyPI</a> was built using <code>go-to-wheel</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/dev/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --set-version-var main.version \\\n  --version 0.1.1 \\\n  --readme README.md \\\n  --author <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Simon Willison<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  --url https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --description <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Scan directories for SQLite databases<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This created a set of wheels in the <code>dist/</code> folder. I tested one of them like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with dist/sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl \\\n  sqlite-scanner --version</pre></div>\n<p>When that spat out the correct version number I was confident everything had worked as planned, so I pushed the whole set of wheels to PyPI using <code>twine upload</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx twine upload dist/<span class=\"pl-k\">*</span></pre></div>\n<p>I had to paste in a PyPI API token I had saved previously and that was all it took.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-expect-to-use-this-pattern-a-lot\">I expect to use this pattern a lot</h4>\n<p><code>sqlite-scanner</code> is very clearly meant as a proof-of-concept for this wider pattern - Python is very much capable of recursively crawling a directory structure looking for files that start with a specific byte prefix on its own!</p>\n<p>That said, I think there's a <em>lot</em> to be said for this pattern. Go is a great complement to Python - it's fast, compiles to small self-contained binaries, has excellent concurrency support and a rich ecosystem of libraries.</p>\n<p>Go is similar to Python in that it has a strong standard library. Go is particularly good for HTTP tooling - I've built several HTTP proxies in the past using Go's excellent <code>net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy</code> handler.</p>\n<p>I've also been experimenting with <a href=\"https://github.com/wazero/wazero\">wazero</a>, Go's robust and mature zero dependency WebAssembly runtime as part of my ongoing quest for the ideal sandbox for running untrusted code. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/wasm-repl-cli\">Here's my latest experiment</a> with that library.</p>\n<p>Being able to seamlessly integrate Go binaries into Python projects without the end user having to think about Go at all - they <code>pip install</code> and everything Just Works - feels like a valuable addition to my toolbox.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/packaging\">packaging</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pypi\">pypi</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/sqlite\">sqlite</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv\">uv</a></p>",

    "summary": "<p><img alt=\"cover.jpg\" class=\"newsletter-image\" src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f821145f-d310-403c-88f4-327758a66606.jpg?w=480&amp;fit=max\" /></p>\n<p>It's taken four months, but the next release of <a href=\"https://logicforprogrammers.com\" target=\"_blank\">Logic for Programmers is now available</a>! v0.13 is over 50,000 words, making it both 20% larger than v0.12 and officially the longest thing I have ever written.<sup id=\"fnref:longest\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:longest\">1</a></sup> Full release notes are <a href=\"https://github.com/logicforprogrammers/book-assets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, but I'll talk a bit about the biggest changes. </p>\n<p>For one, every chapter has been rewritten. Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id=\"fnref:gross-additions\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:gross-additions\">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>\n<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general \"themes\" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/\" target=\"_blank\">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href=\"https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this \"compatibility\" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>\n<p>Just like all the content was in <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/\" target=\"_blank\">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/\" target=\"_blank\">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/\" target=\"_blank\">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>\n<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's \"just\" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>\n<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Conference Season</h2>\n<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy! Here's where I'm speaking so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://qconlondon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QCon London</a>, March 16-19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://craft-conf.com/2026\" target=\"_blank\">Craft Conference</a>, Budapest, June 4-5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareshould.work/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Should Work</a>, Missouri, July 16-17</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hfpug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Functional Programmers</a>, Virtual, December 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the first three I'm giving variations of my talk \"How to find bugs in systems that don't exist\", which I gave last year at <a href=\"https://systemsdistributed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Systems Distributed</a>.

    "title": "We installed a single turnstile to feel secure",
    "link": "https://idiallo.com/blog/installed-single-turnstile-for-security-theater?src=feed",
    "summary": "<p>After the acquisition by a much larger company, security became a top priority. Our company occupied three tall buildings, each at least 13 stories high. Key card readers were installed next to every entrance, every elevator car, and even at the parking lot entrance, which itself was eight stories tall.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The parking lot system was activated first. If you wanted to park your car, you needed to scan your pass. It didn't take long for lines to start forming, but they were still manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Then the doors were activated. I would often forget my key card on my desk and get stuck in the stairwell. After lunch, I'd climb the stairs all the way to the 11th floor, only to find myself locked out at the door. Fortunately, the buildings were full of people, and there was always someone to open the door for me. I'd slip in suspiciously while they contemplated the email that clearly said not to let anyone in with your own card.</p>\n\n<p>While we were battling to get used to the key cards, the company was installing turnstiles on the ground floor of every building. They looked futuristic, but I was already anticipating a problem the designers hadn't considered. Each building had 13 floors. Each floor was full of employees. Hundreds of employees per building would each have to scan their card to get in.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer. I understand that security isn't an optional feature you build on top of your application. Instead, you need to implement safeguards at the foundation. In fact, one of the most important applications I was working on was a tool to manage how different teams retrieved their tasks from Jira. If you've read this blog before, you know I always complain about Jira.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the original designer of this application must have been pressed for time. Each action in the app required a call to the Jira endpoint, which needed authentication. He never saved the auth token returned by the API. Instead, each call had to re-authenticate and then perform its task.</p>\n\n<p>Did he ask the user to reenter the password every single time? No, he was smarter than that. Did he save the credentials in the database in plain text? He might have <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/hiring-angular-experts-not\">been an intern</a>, but he wasn't crazy. No! Instead, he saved the username and password in the cookies. But for good measures, it was base64 encoded.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we received the email. All turnstiles were going to be activated. The following Monday, they would run in mock mode, where the turnstiles would remain open, but we'd have to scan and wait for the beep and green light before entering.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at 8:30am. I met my colleagues and hundreds of other employees in the lobby. When the first person scanned their card, the machine beeped and turned green. We all clapped in celebration. We took turns making our way to the machine. Beep, turn green, next. But it grumbled for some employees and turned red. That was fine though, it was mock day. We all went about our day.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, when I came to work, I remained in my car, stuck in line for the parking lot for at least 10 minutes. Looking outside, I saw long lines of people circling each building.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to park my car and discovered that the line of people extended all the way down to the parking level. I waited in line for at least 30 minutes just to make it to the lobby. I texted my manager that I'd be late for the daily standup because I was stuck in line. She didn't text back. Instead, she waved at me from the front of the line. Scanning was already slow, you had to wait to be approved. But once you passed the turnstile, there was another line for the elevators. The elevator key card readers were also active.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a couple dozen people all trying to squeeze into crowded elevators, each going to a different floor, and each trying to scan their key card to access their floor because someone who wasn't authorized for that floor couldn't scan it for them. Some elevator doors opened with a few people already inside because they couldn't scan their cards in the crowd, so they'd gone back down for a second attempt. In other words, it was complete chaos.</p>\n\n<p>It took more than an hour to go from the parking lot to my desk on the 11th floor.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I decided to save time and take an Uber to work. Those were the days when an <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/paying-for-my-8-years-old-ride\">Uber ride cost only $3</a>. I thought I was being smart, but another hundred people or so had the same idea. We had a pile of Uber rides lining up outside, each trying to drop off their riders and blocking the way to the parking lot, causing yet another traffic jam. Inside the building, it was still the same chaos. I only saved a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>On the third day, they shut down the turnstiles. They clearly weren't working. They also disabled the key card readers in the elevators. It was a relief.</p>\n\n<p>Security was supposedly a priority, yet nobody ever talked about the Jira credentials saved in cookies. I received significant pushback when I requested we install a Redis service to store the generated auth tokens. I had to write entire documents to justify using it and request enterprise support from a vendor. After a month, the security issue was fixed to no fanfare.</p>\n\n<p>We did, however, receive an email celebrating the installation of three new turnstiles in the lobby. They never turned the elevator key card readers back on. They remained dormant, a reminder of the mess we'd gone through.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The turnstiles were visible. They were expensive. They disrupted everyone's day and made headlines in company-wide emails. Management could point to them and say that we're taking security seriously. Meanwhile, thousands of employees had their Jira credentials stored in cookies. A vulnerability that could expose our entire project management system. But that fix required documentation, vendor approval, a month of convincing people it mattered. A whole lot of begging.</p>\n\n<p>Security theater checks a box. It makes people feel like something is being done. Real security is invisible. It's reviewing code, implementing proper authentication, storing tokens correctly. It doesn't come with a ribbon-cutting ceremony or a celebratory email. It's just good engineering that nobody notices when it's done right. But security theater is impossible to miss.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>You’ve probably heard this famous quote from Steve Jobs about saying ‘no’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, we have AI now. We don’t have to say no to 1,000 things. We can say yes to all the things — generate them all, simultaneously!</p>\n<p>Do you really have to “pick carefully” when AI can materialize everything you previously would’ve been too constrained to do?</p>\n<p>Generative technology paired with being “data-driven” means it’s easy to build every idea, ship it, measure it, and see what sticks.</p>\n<p>Humans, money, time — these all used to be constraints which required budgets, trade-offs, and decision making.</p>\n<p>Organizations had an incentive to say “no” when development was constrained — “We can only do so much, so let’s make sure we do the most impactful things.”</p>\n<p>But maybe the scarcity of organizational resources was the wrong focus all along?</p>\n<p>It’s never been a good idea to ship everything you think of. Every addition accretes complexity and comes with a cognitive cost.</p>\n<p>Maybe we need to reframe the concept of scarcity from <em>us</em>, the makers of software, to <em>them</em>, the users of software. Their resources are what matter most:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention (too many features and they can’t all be used, or even tried)</li>\n<li>Stability (too much frequent change is an impediment to learning a product)</li>\n<li>Clarity (too many options creates confusion and paralysis)</li>\n<li>Coherence (too many plots and subplots cannot tell a unified story)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So maybe the way you argue for saying “no” isn’t because it helps <em>you</em> as a business, but because it helps your customers. It helps them make sense of what you’ve made.</p>\n<p>And yet: arguing for customer clarity has always been harder than arguing for internal efficiency or some bottom line.</p>\n<p>In an age of abundance, restraint becomes the only scarce thing left, which means saying “no” is more valuable than ever.</p>\n<p>I’m as proud of the things I haven’t generated as the things I have.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/saying-no/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",

    "summary": "Today's links Michael Swanwick's \"The Universe Box\": Short stories from a science fiction master at the top of his form. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: DRM lobotomizes “human memory”; Crayola hex values; Tattoo artists copyright customers' bodies. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Michael Swanwick's \"The Universe Box\" (permalink) No one writes short stories like Michael Swanwick, the five-time Hugo-winning master of science fiction. To prove it, you need only pick up The Universe Box, Swanwick's just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field's greatest writers at the absolute pinnacle of his game: https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/ Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, multiple sf magazines that publish short stories every month, on paper, and pay for it. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels. That's a pretty common trajectory in sf, where &#8211; notwithstanding the field's status as a haven for the short story &#8211; the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick. It's a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can't assume anything about the story's setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies. All of that has to be established in the story. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There's a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don't tell\"). It's fairer to say that exposition is hard &#8211; dramatization is, well, dramatic, which makes it easier to engage the reader's attention. But great exposition is great and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well: https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/ The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\": https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the reader work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you've been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that's not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded. This is a terrific experience, but it is also work. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the story part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires &#8211; and rewards &#8211; very active attention. (Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain's classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":) https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/ But here's the thing. None of this applies to Swanwick. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there's never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It's not merely that he's a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last. Somehow, though, he just slides these stories into your brain. And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise beginnings (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else). This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.

    "link": "https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/02/corprophagia/",
    "summary": "Today's links Stock swindles: A buyback is not just a dividend by another name. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Acme License-Plate Maker; IPV4 delenda est; Mandatory gun-ownership; Sukey; Ross and Carrie x LRH; Criti-hype. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Stock swindles (permalink) There are plenty of American historical antecedents of Trumpism &#8211; fascist movements like the Jim Crow reign of terror, the McCarthy hearings, the gleeful genocide of indigenous people. But when you're thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn't just a nation of cruel bigots; it's also a nation of rich swindlers. We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it's true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man's idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments &#8211; local, state and federal. He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth Like so many crooked officials, Trump's brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn't &#8211; at any given moment, odds are that he's either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/ Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump has to convince people that they can't rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he &#8211; as a man who is an expert at cheating &#8211; knows how to rig it in your favor: https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/ But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn't actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is actually rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts: https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/ Want to convince people that there's a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there's an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans' houses: https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/ Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren't enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated This is why it's worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don't know what they're talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you're being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it's all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf. Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they're valuable and desirable: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but scientific, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us. In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes up while its value goes down. I mean that literally: say a company that's sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company's capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That's a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it's worth one billion dollars. Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback. What's more, the drop in corporate valuation is more than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company's worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop more than a billion dollars off the company's share price. Instead, it sends the share price up. This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name &#8211; just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits. This is categorically untrue. Dividends do take money out of the company's coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure &#8211; but a dividend is a bet on the company's future success, which is why a company's share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company's stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations. But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn't afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year's blockbuster book. That dividend would not send investors chasing the company's stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won't have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets. Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up. In other words: when a company's stock price rises on news of a dividend, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's management and its future growth. When a company's stock price rises on news of a buyback, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's future looting to the point of collapse. I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I've been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff's book The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, and I've learned even more scummy truths about buybacks: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay half the tax on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth. It's worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital losses. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you've made. But you don't even have to sell the stock to realize tax-free income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid all taxes. Here's how that works: if you're sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you're smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is tax-deductible. If you're rich enough, you don't have to make regular payments on the loan, either &#8211; you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it's due, you borrow even more money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan. That's \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here's \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid all capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets. Now, maybe you're thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I've got bad news for you: you won't qualify for one of those cool loans that you don't need to pay regularly! What's more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), that is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay. Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get much richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don't benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can't spend when rich people don't pay taxes. This is why buybacks have apologists. Buybacks &#8211; a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory &#8211; make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name. It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people: https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/ It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises: https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/ The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" &#8211; literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway's founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway Trump's right: the system is rigged. If you're going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can't insist &#8211; as Hillary Clinton did &#8211; that \"America is already great\": https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078 America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it's not enough to know that the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know how it is rigged and who rigged it.

    "summary": "<p>Ten years ago, I was in a dark season. My first startup had cratered. Confidence, gone. I would walk for hours to clear my head, often through parts of the city we typically hurry past.</p>\n\n<p>One Tuesday, I saw a man sitting outside a boarded-up storefront. He was weathered, his eyes holding a quiet dignity. But I was fixated on a problem to solve. He only had one shoe. The right foot was wrapped in a frayed plastic bag.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I approached, offering to buy him a pair. He smiled, a surprising, warm thing. \"Kind of you,\" he said. \"But this one's enough.\"</p>\n\n<p>I was baffled. Enough? It was objectively not enough. It was a problem to be fixed. I insisted. He listened patiently, then said something that changed my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>\"You see a missing shoe. I see a reminder. Every step I take, I feel the world. The cold, the grit, the wet. It keeps me awake. It tells me I'm moving. The day I get too comfortable is the day I stop feeling the road.\"</p>\n\n<p>I sat with him. I listened. Let's call him David. He spoke not of lack, but of acute awareness. Of a raw, unfiltered connection to his own journey. He was a conscious observer of his circumstance, not a victim.</p>\n\n<p>A gentle rain sprinkled from the sky. He looked up, closed his eyes and embrace every single rain drop. I didn't buy him shoes that day. Instead, I bought us both coffee. We talked for an hour. I told him of my failure. He offered no platitudes, just the quiet acknowledgment that \"the road is rough before it smooths.\"</p>\n\n<p>As I left, a wild, impulsive thought hit me. I took off my own right shoe and left it on the bench. \"A trade,\" I said. \"For the perspective.\"</p>\n\n<p>He laughed, a rich, full sound. I walked back to my empty office in a bespoke suit and one bare foot. The feeling was electric. The vulnerability was terrifying. The concrete was real.</p>\n\n<p>That night, I made two decisions. First, I hired David for a simple, dignified role at the new company I was mustering the courage to build. His insight, his grounded clarity, became a secret weapon in our strategy sessions. He saw through pretense instantly.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I never wore a pair of shoes to work again.</p>\n\n<p>That's right. From that day forward, before I go to a meeting, a negotiation, or any board presentation, I remove my right shoe, place it under my desk and perform my task. The right foot always remain bare.</p>\n\n<p>It is my compass. It grounds me (literally) in the humility of new beginnings. It is a perpetual reminder of the David Principle. True awareness comes from embracing the uncomfortable feel of the road. It forces authenticity. When you negotiate a nine-figure deal with one foot on a cold marble floor, you remember who you are and where you came from.</p>\n\n<p>My team understands. My clients, once startled, now respect it. \"There goes the One-Shoe CEO,\" they say. It's our culture. We don't just solve problems; we <em>feel</em> them.</p>\n\n<p>David has been with the company for a decade now. He's a cherished advisor and friend. We never speak of that first day. The lesson is lived, not referenced.</p>\n\n<p>Why am I sharing this? Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about having the courage to feel the missing piece. To embrace a productive discomfort. To seek wisdom in the most unexpected places and have the conviction to let it alter your path, down to the very shoes you won't wear.</p>\n\n<p>The man with one shoe taught me everything. Because, as it turns out… <strong>I was the shoe on the other foot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lt;/LinkedIn></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Sorry, I'm not sorry!</p>",

Security and privacy reasons.</p>\n<p>If it were not so, somebody could come along with a little JavaScript and uncover a user’s browsing history (imagine, for example, setting styles for visited and unvisited links, then using <code>window.getComputedStyle</code> and checking style computations).</p>\n<p>MDN says browsers tell little white lies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To preserve users' privacy, browsers lie to web applications under certain circumstances</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, from what I can tell, when I write <code>.entry:has(a:visited)</code> the browser is telling the engine that handles styling that all <code>.entry</code> items have never been <code>:visited</code> (even if they have been).</p>\n<p>So where does that leave me?</p>\n<p>Now I will abandon CSS and go use JavaScript for something only JavaScript can do.</p>\n<p>That’s a good reason for JS.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/browsers-white-lies/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",

    "summary": "<p>I have come to appreciate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development\">coding\nagents</a> to be\nvaluable tools for working with computer program code in any capacity, such as\nlearning about any program’s architecture, diagnosing bugs or developing proofs\nof concept. Depending on the use-case, reviewing each command the agent wants to\nrun can get tedious and time-consuming very quickly. To safely run a coding\nagent without review, I wanted a Virtual Machine (VM) solution where the agent\nhas no access to my personal files and where it’s no big deal if the agent gets\ncompromised by malware: I can just throw away the VM and start over.</p>\n<p>Instead of setting up a stateful VM and re-installing it when needed (ugh!), I\nprefer the model of ephemeral VMs where nothing persists on disk, except for\nwhat is explicitly shared with the host.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/microvm-nix/microvm.nix\"><code>microvm.nix</code> project</a> makes it\neasy to create such VMs on NixOS, and this article shows you how I like to set\nup my VMs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"see-also\">See also</h2>\n<p>If you haven’t heard of NixOS before, check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS\">the NixOS Wikipedia\npage</a> and\n<a href=\"https://nixos.org/\">nixos.org</a>. I <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/talks/#2025\">spoke about why I switched to Nix in\n2025</a> and have published a <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/tags/nix/\">few blog posts about\nNix</a>.</p>\n<p>For understanding the threat model of AI agents, read <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/\">Simon Willison’s “The\nlethal trifecta for AI agents: private data, untrusted content, and external\ncommunication” (June\n2025)</a>. This\narticle’s approach to working with the threat model is to remove the “private\ndata” part from the equation.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn about the whole field of sandboxing, check out <a href=\"https://www.luiscardoso.dev/blog/sandboxes-for-ai\">Luis\nCardoso’s “A field guide to sandboxes for AI” (Jan\n2026)</a>. I will not be\ncomparing different solutions in this article, I will just show you one possible\npath.</p>\n<p>And lastly, maybe you’re not in the mood to build/run sandboxing infrastructure\nyourself. Good news: Sandboxing is a hot topic and there are many commercial\nofferings popping up that address this need. For example, David Crawshaw and\nJosh Bleecher Snyder (I know both from the Go community) recently launched\n<a href=\"https://blog.exe.dev/meet-exe.dev\">exe.dev</a>, an agent-friendly VM hosting\nservice. Another example is <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/\">Fly.io, who launched\nSprites</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-microvmnix\">Setting up microvm.nix</h2>\n<p>Let’s jump right in!

Afterwards, Claude reports back with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The dcsvm microvm has been set up successfully.

In my experience, Claude always got the VM creation correct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replicating-this-setup-with-claude-code\">Replicating this setup with Claude Code</h2>\n<p>In fact, you can go one step further: Instead of just asking Claude to create\nnew MicroVMs, you can also ask Claude to replicate this entire setup into your\nNixOS configuration!</p>\n<p>Try a prompt like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>read\n<a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/\">https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/</a>\n— I want the exact same setup in my midna NixOS configuration please!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>NixOS has a reputation of being hard to adopt, but once you are using NixOS, you\ncan do powerful things like spinning up ephemeral MicroVMs for a new project\nwithin minutes.</p>\n<p>The maintenance effort is minimal: When I update my personal PC, my MicroVM\nconfigurations start using the new software versions, too. Customization is easy\nif needed.</p>\n<p>This actually mirrors my experience with Coding Agents: I don’t feel like\nthey’re <em>automatically</em> making existing tasks more efficient, I feel that they\nmake things possible that were previously out of reach (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\">Jevons\nparadox</a>).</p>\n<p>It was fascinating (and scary!) to experience the quality increase of Coding\nAgents during 2025. At the beginning of 2025 I thought that LLMs are an\noverhyped toy, and felt it was almost insulting when people showed me text or\ncode produced by these models. But almost every new frontier model release got\nsignificantly better, and by now I have been positively surprised by Claude\nCode’s capabilities and quality many times. It has produced code that handles\nlegitimate edge cases I would not have considered.</p>\n<p>With this article, I showed one possible way to run Coding Agents safely (or any\nworkload that shouldn’t access your private data, really) that you can adjust in\nmany ways for your needs.</p>",

    "summary": "In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just \"the process of writing software\", I believe) with the term \"Automatic Programming\".\n<br />\n<br />In case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.\n<br />\n<br />Please, stop saying \"Claude vibe coded this software for me\". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.\n<br />\n<br />When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.\n<br />\n<br />That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.\n<br />\n<br />I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.\n<br />\n<br />Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).\n<a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/159\">Comments</a>",

    "title": "How does AI impact skill formation?",
    "link": "https://seangoedecke.com/how-does-ai-impact-skill-formation/",
    "summary": "<p>Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20245\"><em>How AI Impacts Skill Formation</em></a>. Like <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/your-brain-on-chatgpt\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning\">papers</a> on AI before it, this one is being <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1qqy2ro/anthropic_ai_assisted_coding_doesnt_show/\">treated</a> as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?</p>\n<p>The structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872\"><em>Your Brain on ChatGPT</em></a>. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.</p>\n<p>The banner result was that <strong>AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz</strong>. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don’t think that conclusion is reasonable.</p>\n<h3>Retyping AI-generated code</h3>\n<p>To see why, let’s look at Figure 13 from the paper:</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/static/1deb94af67210428f7358afe10795555/f238d/fig13.png\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: block;\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"display: block;\"></span>\n  <img alt=\"figure 13\" class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/static/1deb94af67210428f7358afe10795555/fcda8/fig13.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"figure 13\" />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time <em>literally retyping the AI-generated code</em> into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or “manual coding”: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. <strong>If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.</strong></p>\n<p>I confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-1\">1</a></sup>)? It certainly didn’t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.</p>\n<p>In any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn’t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up. </p>\n<h3>What about the quiz scores?</h3>\n<p>Even if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?</p>\n<p>Well, first we should note that <strong>the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz</strong>. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.</p>\n<p>But of course much current AI use is not like this: if you’re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you’re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?</p>\n<p>Well yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you’d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it’s pretty silly to deny this: it’s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.</p>\n<p>Still, I have two points to make about this.</p>\n<h4>Software engineers are paid to ship, not to learn</h4>\n<p>First, <strong>software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase</strong>. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you’re learning more efficiently. That’s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn’t make it false.</p>\n<p>Other professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don’t atrophy.</p>\n<h4>Moving faster gives you more opportunities to learn</h4>\n<p>The other point I wanted to make is that <strong>even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall</strong>. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you’re learning less overall depends on <em>how many more tasks you’re doing</em>. If you’re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they’ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.</p>\n<h3>We need to talk about GPT-4o</h3>\n<p>Finally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I’m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of “well, you just haven’t tried the <em>right</em> model”. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.</p>\n<p>Still, I’m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted <em>in 2025</em><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-2\">2</a></sup>, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that’s like five years in AI time). I can’t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>I don’t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure “just give the problem to the model” AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.</p>\n<p>I don’t like their conclusion that AI use doesn’t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time <em>literally retyping AI code</em>. I wish they’d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don’t really blame them for the result - I’m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.</p>\n<p>Overall, I don’t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn’t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing “build me a todo app” into Claude Code means you’ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.</p>\n<p>That said, I’d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It’s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it’s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.</p>\n<p>edit: the popular tech youtuber Theo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZINQTR6H5dI\">cited</a> this post as a source for his video on this paper. I liked Theo’s video. I don’t agree with his point about adjusting to a new setup - in my view that would also apply to the non-AI-using group - and I thought the crack about the kind of people who make syntax errors in Python was a bit uncalled-for. However, I agree that (a) the people in the study are not incentivized to spend time teaching themselves about Trio, and (b) this study does not do anywhere near as good a job at targeting real-world use as the well-known <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/impact-of-ai-study\">METR study</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>See Figure 17.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-1\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I suppose the study doesn’t say that explicitly, but the Anthropic Fellows program was only launched in December 2024, and the paper was published in January 2026.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-2\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

    "title": "Pi: The Minimal Agent Within OpenClaw",
    "link": "https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/31/pi/",
    "summary": "<p>If you haven&#8217;t been living under a rock, you will have noticed this week that a\nproject of my friend Peter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw\">went viral on the\ninternet</a>.  It went by many names. The\nmost recent one is <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\">OpenClaw</a> but in the news you might\nhave encountered it as ClawdBot or MoltBot depending on when you read about it.\nIt is an agent connected to a communication channel of your choice that <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/3/tools/\">just\nruns code</a>.</p>\n<p>What you might be less familiar with is that what&#8217;s under the hood of OpenClaw\nis a little coding agent called <a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/\">Pi</a>. And\nPi happens to be, at this point, the coding agent that I use almost exclusively.\nOver the last few weeks I became more and more of a shill for the little agent.\nAfter I gave a talk on this recently, I realized that I did not actually write\nabout Pi on this blog yet, so I feel like I might want to give some context on\nwhy I&#8217;m obsessed with it, and how it relates to OpenClaw.</p>\n<p>Pi is written by <a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/\">Mario Zechner</a> and unlike Peter, who\naims for &#8220;sci-fi with a touch of madness,&#8221; <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Mario is very grounded.  Despite\nthe differences in approach, both OpenClaw and Pi follow the same idea: LLMs are\nreally good at writing and running code, so embrace this.  In some ways I think\nthat&#8217;s not an accident because Peter got me and Mario hooked on this idea, and\nagents last year.</p>\n<h2>What is Pi?</h2>\n<p>So Pi is a coding agent.  And there are many coding agents.  Really, I think you\ncan pick effectively anyone off the shelf at this point and you will be able to\nexperience what it&#8217;s like to do agentic programming.  In reviews on this blog\nI&#8217;ve positively talked about AMP and one of the reasons I resonated so much with\nAMP is that it really felt like it was a product built by people who got both\naddicted to agentic programming but also had tried a few different things to see\nwhich ones work and not just to build a fancy UI around it.</p>\n<p>Pi is interesting to me because of two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First of all, it has a tiny core. It has the shortest system prompt of any\nagent that I&#8217;m aware of and it only has four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. </li>\n<li>The second thing is that it makes up for its tiny core by providing an\nextension system that also allows extensions to persist state into sessions,\nwhich is incredibly powerful. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>And a little bonus: Pi itself is written like excellent software. It doesn&#8217;t\nflicker, it doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of memory, it doesn&#8217;t randomly break, it is\nvery reliable and it is written by someone who takes great care of what goes\ninto the software.</p>\n<p>Pi also is a collection of little components that you can build your own agent\non top.  That&#8217;s how OpenClaw is built, and that&#8217;s also how I built my own little\nTelegram bot and how Mario built his\n<a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/mom\">mom</a>.  If you want\nto build your own agent, connected to something, Pi when pointed to itself and\nmom, will conjure one up for you.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Not In Pi</h2>\n<p>And in order to understand what&#8217;s in Pi, it&#8217;s even more important to understand\nwhat&#8217;s not in Pi, why it&#8217;s not in Pi and more importantly: why it won&#8217;t be in\nPi.  The most obvious omission is support for MCP.  There is no MCP support in\nit. While you could build an extension for it, you can also do what OpenClaw\ndoes to support MCP which is to use\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steipete/mcporter\">mcporter</a>. mcporter exposes MCP calls via\na CLI interface or TypeScript bindings and maybe your agent can do something\nwith it.  Or not, I don&#8217;t know :)</p>\n<p>And this is not a lazy omission.  This is from the philosophy of how Pi works.\nPi&#8217;s entire idea is that if you want the agent to do something that it doesn&#8217;t\ndo yet, you don&#8217;t go and download an extension or a skill or something like\nthis. You ask the agent to extend itself.  It celebrates the idea of code\nwriting and running code.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that you cannot download extensions.  It is very much\nsupported. But instead of necessarily encouraging you to download someone else&#8217;s\nextension, you can also point your agent to an already existing extension, say\nlike, build it like the thing you see over there, but make these changes to it\nthat you like.</p>\n<h2>Agents Built for Agents Building Agents</h2>\n<p>When you look at what Pi and by extension OpenClaw are doing, there is an\nexample of software that is malleable like clay.  And this sets certain\nrequirements for the underlying architecture of it that are actually in many\nways setting certain constraints on the system that really need to go into the\ncore design.</p>\n<p>So for instance, Pi&#8217;s underlying AI SDK is written so that a session can really\ncontain many different messages from many different model providers. It\nrecognizes that the portability of sessions is somewhat limited between model\nproviders and so it doesn&#8217;t lean in too much into any model-provider-specific\nfeature set that cannot be transferred to another.</p>\n<p>The second is that in addition to the model messages it maintains custom\nmessages in the session files which can be used by extensions to store state or\nby the system itself to maintain information that either not at all is sent to\nthe AI or only parts of it.</p>\n<p>Because this system exists and extension state can also be persisted to disk, it\nhas built-in hot reloading so that the agent can write code, reload, test it and\ngo in a loop until your extension actually is functional.  It also ships with\ndocumentation and examples that the agent itself can use to extend itself.  Even\nbetter: sessions in Pi are trees.  You can branch and navigate within a session\nwhich opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities such as enabling workflows\nfor making a side-quest to fix a broken agent tool without wasting context in\nthe main session.  After the tool is fixed, I can rewind the session back to\nearlier and Pi summarizes what has happened on the other branch.</p>\n<p>This all matters because for instance if you consider how MCP works, on most\nmodel providers, tools for MCP, like any tool for the LLM, need to be loaded\ninto the system context or the tool section thereof on session start.  That\nmakes it very hard to impossible to fully reload what tools can do without\ntrashing the complete cache or confusing the AI about how prior invocations work\ndifferently.</p>\n<h2>Tools Outside The Context</h2>\n<p>An extension in Pi can register a tool to be available to the LLM to call and\nevery once in a while I find this useful. For instance, despite my criticism of\nhow Beads is implemented, I do think that giving an agent access to a to-do list\nis a very useful thing. And I do use an agent-specific issue tracker that works\nlocally that I had my agent build itself. And because I wanted the agent to also\nmanage to-dos, in this particular case I decided to give it a tool rather than a\nCLI.  It felt appropriate for the scope of the problem and it is currently the\nonly additional tool that I&#8217;m loading into my context.</p>\n<p>But for the most part all of what I&#8217;m adding to my agent are either skills or\nTUI extensions to make working with the agent more enjoyable for me.  Beyond\nslash commands, Pi extensions can render custom TUI components directly in the\nterminal: spinners, progress bars, interactive file pickers, data tables,\npreview panes.  The TUI is flexible enough that Mario proved you can <a href=\"https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2008702661093454039\">run Doom\nin it</a>.  Not practical,\nbut if you can run Doom, you can certainly build a useful dashboard or debugging\ninterface.</p>\n<p>I want to highlight some of my extensions to give you an idea of what&#8217;s\npossible.  While you can use them unmodified, the whole idea really is that you\npoint your agent to one and remix it to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/answer.ts\"><code>/answer</code></a></h3>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/17/what-is-plan-mode/\">don&#8217;t use plan mode</a>.  I encourage the agent\nto ask questions and there&#8217;s a productive back and forth.  But I don&#8217;t like\nstructured question dialogs that happen if you give the agent a question tool.\nI prefer the agent&#8217;s natural prose with explanations and diagrams interspersed.</p>\n<p>The problem: answering questions inline gets messy.  So <code>/answer</code> reads the\nagent&#8217;s last response, extracts all the questions, and reformats them into a\nnice input box.</p>\n<img alt=\"The /answer extension showing a question dialog\" src=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/static/pi-answer.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/todos.ts\"><code>/todos</code></a></h3>\n<p>Even though I criticize <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\">Beads</a> for its\nimplementation, giving an agent a to-do list is genuinely useful.  The <code>/todos</code>\ncommand brings up all items stored in <code>.pi/todos</code> as markdown files.  Both the\nagent and I can manipulate them, and sessions can claim tasks to mark them as in\nprogress.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/review.ts\"><code>/review</code></a></h3>\n<p>As more code is written by agents, it makes little sense to throw unfinished\nwork at humans before an agent has reviewed it first.  Because Pi sessions are\ntrees, I can branch into a fresh review context, get findings, then bring fixes\nback to the main session.</p>\n<img alt=\"The /review extension showing review preset options\" src=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/static/pi-review.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\n<p>The UI is modeled after Codex which provides easy to review commits, diffs,\nuncommitted changes, or remote PRs.  The prompt pays attention to things I care\nabout so I get the call-outs I want (eg: I ask it to call out newly added\ndependencies.)</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/control.ts\"><code>/control</code></a></h3>\n<p>An extension I experiment with but don&#8217;t actively use.  It lets one Pi agent send\nprompts to another.  It is a simple multi-agent system without complex\norchestration which is useful for experimentation.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/files.ts\"><code>/files</code></a></h3>\n<p>Lists all files changed or referenced in the session.  You can reveal them in\nFinder, diff in VS Code, quick-look them, or reference them in your prompt.\n<code>shift+ctrl+r</code> quick-looks the most recently mentioned file which is handy when\nthe agent produces a PDF.</p>\n<p>Others have built extensions too: <a href=\"https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents\">Nico&#8217;s subagent\nextension</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-interactive-shell\">interactive-shell</a> which\nlets Pi autonomously run interactive CLIs in an observable TUI overlay.</p>\n<h2>Software Building Software</h2>\n<p>These are all just ideas of what you can do with your agent.  The point of it\nmostly is that none of this was written by me, it was created by the agent to my\nspecifications.  I told Pi to make an extension and it did.  There is no MCP, there are\nno community skills, nothing.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I use tons of skills.  But\nthey are hand-crafted by my clanker and not downloaded from anywhere.  For\ninstance I fully replaced all my CLIs or MCPs for browser automation with a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/skills/web-browser/SKILL.md\">skill that just uses\nCDP</a>.\nNot because the alternatives don&#8217;t work, or are bad, but because this is just\neasy and natural.  The agent maintains its own functionality.</p>\n<p>My agent has <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/tree/main/skills\">quite a few\nskills</a> and crucially\nI throw skills away if I don&#8217;t need them.  I for instance gave it a skill to\nread Pi sessions that other engineers shared, which helps with code review.  Or\nI have a skill to help the agent craft the commit messages and commit behavior I\nwant, and how to update changelogs.  These were originally slash commands, but\nI&#8217;m currently migrating them to skills to see if this works equally well.  I\nalso have a skill that hopefully helps Pi use <code>uv</code> rather than <code>pip</code>, but I also\nadded a custom extension to intercept calls to <code>pip</code> and <code>python</code> to redirect\nthem to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Part of the fascination that working with a minimal agent like Pi gave me is\nthat it makes you live that idea of using software that builds more software.\nThat taken to the extreme is when you remove the UI and output and connect it\nto your chat.  That&#8217;s what OpenClaw does and given its tremendous growth,\nI really feel more and more that this is going to become our future in one\nway or another.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292\">https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292</a><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#fnref-1\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

We are also excited to announce that our\ninstalled base now has more than 2.5 billion active devices, which\nis a testament to incredible customer satisfaction for the very\nbest products and services in the world.”</p>\n\n<p>“During the December quarter, our record business performance and\nstrong margins led to EPS growth of 19 percent, setting a new\nall-time EPS record,” said Kevan Parekh, Apple’s CFO. “These\nexceptionally strong results generated nearly $54 billion in\noperating cash flow, allowing us to return almost $32 billion to\nshareholders.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>John Markoff, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/16/technology/michael-dell-should-eat-his-words-apple-chief-suggests.html?unlocked_article_code=1.IVA.y8q3.O6oeC_ygiktA\">writing for The New York Times 20 years ago</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It may not be the last laugh, but on Friday afternoon, after the\nclose of the stock market, Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of\nApple Computer, shared an e-mail chuckle with his employees at the\nexpense of Dell, a big rival.</p>\n\n<p>The message was prompted by the 12 percent surge in Apple’s stock\nprice last week, which pushed the company’s market capitalization\nto $72.13 billion, passing Dell’s value of $71.97 billion.</p>\n\n<p>In 1997, shortly after Mr. Jobs returned to Apple, the company he\nhelped start in 1976, Dell’s founder and chairman, Michael S.\nDell, was asked at a technology conference what might be done to\nfix Apple, then deeply troubled financially.</p>\n\n<p>“What would I do?” Mr. Dell said to an audience of several\nthousand information technology managers. “I’d shut it down and\ngive the money back to the shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, apparently savoring the moment, Mr. Jobs sent a brief\ne-mail message to Apple employees, which read: “Team, it turned\nout that Michael Dell wasn’t perfect at predicting the future.\nBased on today’s stock market close, Apple is worth more than\nDell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow,\nbut I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today.

Threads' margin is the Eurostack's opportunity (permalink) OG App is the coolest app you've never heard of. Back in 2022, two teenagers unilaterally disenshittified Instagram by making an \"alt-client\" that restored all the parts of Insta that made it a success and blocked all the antifeatures that Meta crammed down users' throats after they had them locked in. Here's how OG App worked: first, it popped up a browser window and loaded the Instagram login screen. Then, after you'd logged into Insta, it stole the \"session key\" (the cryptographic proof that you were logged into your account). That let it impersonate you to Insta's servers, and slurp down the whole feed that Insta had queued up for you. After grabbing your feed, OG App deleted all the ads, all the slop, all the boosted content, all the months-old clickbait that The Algorithm (TM) had surfaced. What was left was pristine: the posts from people you followed, in reverse-chronological order. To make this all even sweeter, OG App sent no data back to Meta as you used it, except for the likes and comments you intended to transmit to the company. All the other data that Meta's apps gather got blocked: everything from your location, to which posts you slowed down your scrolling on, to accelerometer readouts that revealed minute changes in how you hold your phone from second to second. Boy did people like this! By the end of the day, OG App was in the top ten charts for both Google and Apple's app stores. By the next morning, it was gone. Meta sent a takedown notice to the app store duopoly and they killed OG App on its behalf (there is honor among thieves): https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/ The funny thing is, the OG App creators were just following the Facebook playbook. When Facebook opened up to the general public in 2006, it had the problem that everyone who wanted social media already had an account on Myspace, and all of Facebook's improvements on Myspace (Zuck made a promise never to spy on his users!) didn't matter, because Myspace had something Facebook could not match: Myspace had all your friends. Facebook came up with an ingenious solution to this problem: they offered Myspace users a bot. You gave that bot your Myspace login credentials (just as OG App did with your Insta credentials) and the bot impersonated you to Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and it grabbed everything queued up for you on Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and then flowed those messages into your Facebook feed (just as OG App did with Insta). This was very successful! Users didn't have to choose between their friends on Myspace and the superior design and privacy policies of Facebook. They got to eat their cake and have it, too. This is actually a very old and important pattern in tech. It's what \"move fast and break things\" looks like when it's actually disrupting sclerotic and decaying companies that lock us in, take us for granted, and treat us like shit. It's what Apple did when they cloned the MS Office file formats and released iWork, whose Pages, Numbers and Keynote let Microsoft users escape from the prison of Windows and bring their documents with them: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay But like every pirate, the tech companies dreamed of being admirals. Once they'd attained the admiralty, they announced that when they did this stuff, it was progress, but if anyone does it to them, it would be piracy. What's more, they were able to take advantage of a metastasizing blob of IP laws that the US Trade Representative spread around the world (with threats of tariffs for noncompliance). Soon, nearly every country had enacted laws that made it a literal crime for their entrepreneurs and technologists to fix America's defective tech exports by adding privacy tools, bridging old services into new ones, or reading and writing America's ubiquitous proprietary file-formats: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition For decades, this system was immovable. The world couldn't afford tariffs on its exports to the USA, and it was able to maintain the pretense that America's platforms were trustworthy neutral parties, that would not be weaponized against their own national interest at the behest of the American state. Obviously, that is dead now. Donald Trump, debilitated by white matter disease and his endemic incontinent belligerence, has flipped the table over in a poker game that was rigged in his favor because he resented having to pretend to play (TM November Kelly): https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar EU member-states are minting new \"digital sovereignty\" ministries as fast as they can print up new business cards, the EU itself has just appointed its first \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar: https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen_en They're building the \"Eurostack,\" a fleet of EU-based data centers that will host free, open, auditable, trustworthy equivalents to the US tech giants' offerings: https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/25/eurostack/#viktor-orbans-isp But Eurostack is about to run into a wall: Article 6 of the EU's own Copyright Directive, which prohibits reverse-engineering and modification of tech products. It's a law that the US Trade Rep lobbied hard for, winning the day by promising tariff-free access to the US for Europe's exports (a promise Trump has now broken): https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate So long as Europe continues to hold up its end of this one-sided bargain, it will not be able to create the reverse-engineering based tools to let EU companies, governments and households get their data out of US tech silos, let alone let them build and enjoy successors to OG App, which will make it easy for them to leave US social media without sacrificing contact with the people who matter to them. Which brings me to Threads, Meta's latest social media network. Threads is built on Activitypub and Mastodon, these being open/free, auditable and trustworthy protocols, designed to support \"federated\" social media. That's social media that runs on servers managed by lots of different entities, whose users can all connect to one another no matter which server they use. Meta was clearly excited by the prospect of enclosing and conquering this open upstart, but also nervous at the prospect that its users would find, in federation, an easy path to escape from Meta's clutches. After all, if you can leave Threads and join a non-Meta Mastodon server without losing contact with the people you followed and were followed by on Threads, then why wouldn't you leave? Mark Zuckerberg's users don't like him &#8211; they just hate him less than they love the people they are in community with on Zuckerberg's platforms. So Threads never really joined the Fediverse. You can't quite follow and be followed by Mastodon users, and you can't quite migrate your account off Meta's servers and onto a better one. Zuck and his lieutenants are keenly attuned to any design that drives high \"switching costs\" for leaving their services, and they exploit these switching costs to figure out just how much pain they can inflict on users without risking their departure: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs So now they've started to turn the screws on Threads users. They just announced a global program of Threads enshittification, with a promise to cram ads into the eyeballs of every Threads account: https://www.contentgrip.com/meta-threads-ads-go-global/ This represents a hell of an opportunity for the EU and Eurostack. Meta's ads are wildly illegal in the EU, violating Europe's landmark privacy law, the GDPR. The only reason Meta gets away with its flagrant lawbreaking is that it has captured the Irish state, and uses legal tricks to force all GDPR enforcement into Irish jurisdiction: https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta People hate ads. More than half of all web users have installed an adblocker (which also protects their privacy). It's the largest consumer boycott in human history: https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/ But no one has ever installed an adblocker for an app, because reverse-engineering apps and the mobile platforms they run on is illegal under laws like Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. As a result, tech companies &#8211; especially US giants, who can violate EU law with impunity &#8211; love to enshittify their apps, because they know that no one can do unto them as they did unto their own rivals (like Myspace). Meta's new ad strategy for Threads is the perfect cue for a European repeal of Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. Procedurally, this is a great moment for it, as the EU is finalizing the Digital Fairness Act, which could include an exemption to EUCD 6 for privacy-enhancing technologies: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-protecting-our-democracy-upholding-our-values/file-digital-fairness-act Giving Europeans an effective way to push back against Meta's wholesale violation of their rights is a way that the Eurostack can score popular support right now &#8211; not in five years when the new data centers come online. It's a way of improving the lives of Europeans in immediate, concrete ways, rather than asking them to be grateful that some ministry has changed cloud providers &#8211; an important change, sure, but one that has no real impact on their daily lives. What's more, legalizing jailbreaking for the purpose of making Threads alt-clients wouldn't just give Europeans a better social media experience &#8211; it could bootstrap European social media services. Remember, Threads was able to achieve instant scale by moving Instagram users onto Threads wholesale, maintaining their Insta follows and followers when they created their Threads accounts. Europe &#8211; like everywhere else &#8211; is full of entrepreneurs who are trying to get national, independent social media platforms off the ground, hoping to woo users by promising them a more privacy-respecting alternative. They've got the same problem Zuck had when he tried to compete with Myspace: users love their friends more than they hate being spied on, so merely offering a better service is insufficient. To get users off the old platforms, you have to lower their switching costs &#8211; you have to let them bring their friends to the new network, even if those friends are still stuck on the old network. Legalize jailbreaking in the EU and you'll make it possible to do \"on-device bridging\" &#8211; where a new social media app is able to break open the data storage of the Threads app on the same device and move that data into its own feeds. And because the EU has the GDPR, they have the privacy framework needed to police the privacy violations that breaking into other apps' data storage can lead to. Meta will squawk. They'll say Europe is legalizing the violation of its corporate rights. But Meta violates Europeans' rights at scale, and the \"rights\" that I'm talking about taking away from Meta are rights the EU gave it in the first place, in exchange for a broken promise of tariff-free access to the USA. Adblocking isn't stealing. Adblocking is bargaining. Without adblocking, the companies don't sell us services in exchange for our privacy &#8211; they plunder all the private data they can get, and dribble out services at whatever level they think we deserve. If ad-supported media was a restaurant, it'd be one where you got thrown up against a wall, relieved of your wallet, fed a handful of gruel, and then got kicked in the ass and sent on your way: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah Every time Donald Trump threatens the EU, he makes the case for the Eurostack, but still, he can't help himself. Likewise, every time Zuckerberg enshittifies his services, he makes the case for repealing Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and he can't help himself either. Threads' inexorable enshittification is an opportunity: an opportunity to make the case for the Eurostack, an opportunity to improve the lives of millions of Europeans, and an opportunity to break through the walled gardens that keep the people we love stuck on legacy social media platforms. When they did it to us, that wasn't progress. When we do it to them, it's not piracy.

    "link": "https://idiallo.com/blog/large-language-models-make-us-feel-smarter?src=feed",
    "summary": "<p>After watching a Veritasium video, I feel a surge of intellectual confidence. I feel smarter. Whether it's a video on lasers or quantum physics, it seems like I have a better grasp on the subject. I finally get it. Derek and his crew just have a way of simplifying complex ideas, unraveling their mysteries, and lifting your confidence as each term is explained.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Every video they release is logically sound. Almost as if I could have come to the same conclusion if I'd spent an equal amount of time as they did. Except I only spent 30 minutes watching the video. And now, whenever someone brings up quantum physics or lasers, the bells ring in my head.</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh, I know quantum physics.\"</p>\n\n<p>And then I try to explain.</p>\n\n<p>\"So it's all about uncertainty. You have the qubit, and it can be zero or one... or both. Wait no, that's quantum computers. Quantum physics is more about strings. When things are much smaller than atoms, the rules are different. And then one particle can affect another particle, even at a large distance. Even if it's on the other side of the universe. Trust me, it's very interesting. You just have to watch the video.\"</p>\n\n<p>You should watch the video indeed. The problem is that Derek understood the subject and explained it confidently. What we do is watch it passively and pick up on his confident tone. It's the illusion of understanding, an afterglow of a compelling narrative, delivered with authority. Teaching or explaining is like a reality check for our knowledge. If you want to know how well you understood a subject, try explaining it. You'll quickly differentiate your confidence from your competence.</p>\n\n<p>With YouTube videos, you at least have to watch the whole video to develop that confidence. But with ChatGPT, you just type a question, and an authoritative voice presents you with all the information you need to win an argument. This argument is usually delivered via screenshot and shared on social media as proof for whatever statement is being defended.</p>\n\n<p>LLMs have accelerated this confidence in people without necessarily improving our knowledge. For the most part, when people quote an LLM, they don't read past the part that agrees with them. It's even better when it's a Google AI overview that highlights just the part you need and can never be cited.</p>\n\n<p>The medium is the message. With LLMs, we seek answers, not knowledge. It's almost as if the time spent researching is directly proportional to the amount of information we retain. If you watch a 60-second fast-paced video that teaches cooking hacks on TikTok, it probably won't turn you into a cook. You'll be entertained though and have the confidence of a cook.</p>\n\n<p>When you ask an LLM to explain a complex subject, you can read it through and understand it in that one sitting. But you probably won't grasp it enough to apply it or explain it to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>But fear not, it's not all doom and gloom. You can learn about quantum physics from a video. First, you should try explaining it to see if you understand it. If not, you can rewatch it actively. Take notes, read more articles, immerse yourself in the subject. Turn entertainment into education by doing something with the information. Sketch it on paper, talk about it with peers interested in the subject. If you're going to use an LLM to understand, read all the material and have follow-up questions that you can revisit in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The point is to turn that initial confidence into active participation that motivates you to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>But most importantly, avoid the temptation of the medium. When you watch a fascinating lecture on YouTube, the most natural thing to do next is to watch another fascinating video on YouTube. Avoid this at all costs because there are infinite videos to watch.</p>\n\n<p>Having confidence after watching interesting content isn't a bad thing. But it should be used as motivation to dig deeper. Otherwise, it's just vanity.</p>",

    "summary": "rj Today's links Disenshittification Nation: How Canada can defend itself from Trump, make billions of dollars, and build a new, global, good internet. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: \"Project Blue Sky\"; O'Reilly v Graham on inequality; Big Pharma's worst nightmare; Dissipation of rents; Shoelace v Ming vases; \"Diviner's Tale\": Great Humungous Snow Pile; Trudeau signs Harper's trade deal; On Comity (pts 1 &#38; 2); What's that dingus called? Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Disenshittification Nation (permalink) Yesterday, I gave the keynote address at the 2026 Digital Government Leaders Summit in Ottawa, Canada &#8211; an invitation only for CIOs, CTOs and senior technical personnel at Canadian federal ministries. It was an honour to give this talk, and the organizers at the office of the CIO of the Government of Canada were kind enough to give me permission to post the transcript: Like all the best Americans, I am a Canadian, and while I have lived abroad for more than two decades, I flatter myself that I am still steeped in our folkways, and so as is traditional at events like this, I would like to begin by apologising. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I know that at a tech event, you expect to hear from a speaker who will come up and tell you how to lose hundreds of billions of dollars building data-centres for the money-losingest technology in human history, a technology so wildly defective that we've had to come up with new, exotic words to describe its defects, like \"hallucination.\" A technology that will never recoup the capex already firehosed on &#8211; let alone the trillions committed to it &#8211; and whose only possible path to glory is to somehow get so good that it makes millions of people unemployed. But don't worry: you can't make the word-guessing program into a \"superintelligence\" by shoveling more words into it. That's like betting that if you keep breeding horses to run faster and faster, one of them will eventually give birth to a locomotive. So I don't have any suggestions for you today for ways to lose billions of dollars. I don't have any ideas for how to destroy as many Canadian jobs as possible, I don't even have any ideas to make Canada more dependent on US tech giants. No, all I have for you today is a plan to make Canada tens of billions of dollars, by offering products and services that people want and will pay for, while securing the country's resiliency and digital sovereignty, and winning the trade war, and setting the American people free, and launching our tech sector into a stable orbit for decades. So once again, I'm sorry. So, so sorry. I want to start by telling you a tariff story. It's not the story that started last year. It's a story that goes all the way back to the early 2000s. Indeed, the very start of this story dates back to 1998. It starts in Washington, in October, 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a big, gnarly bill called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (or DMCA) into law. Section 1201 &#8211; the \"anti-circumvention clause\" &#8211; of the DMCA establishes a new felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for anyone who bypasses an \"access control\" while modifying a digital system. These penalties apply irrespective of why you're making that modification, and they apply even if the device you're modifying is your own property. Which means that if the manufacturer decides you shouldn't be able to do something with your digital device, well, you can't do it. Even if it's yours. Even if the thing you want to do is perfectly legal. Right from the start, it was clear that this law was a bad idea. It was an enshittifier's charter. Once you ban users from modifying their own property, you leave them defenceless. The manufacturer can sell you a gadget and then push an over-the-air update that degrades its functionality, and then demand that you pay a monthly \"subscription\" fee to get that functionality back. This is a law purpose-built for anyone who aspires to graduate from the Darth Vader MBA, where the first and only lesson is, \"I'm altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.\" Immediately upon the passage of this bill, two things happened: first, American tech companies started to rip off the American public, taking advantage of the fact that it was now a crime to disenshittify your own property; and second, the US Trade Representative went around the world in search of biddable public officials who could be flattered or bullied into bringing an anti-circumvention law onto their own country's lawbooks. The US had to get all its trading partners to pass these laws, otherwise those countries' own tech companies would go into business selling tools to disenshittify America's defective tech exports: privacy blockers, jailbreaks, alternative clients, generic consumables, diagnostic tools, compatible parts and spares. But if America could arm-twist its trading partners into passing anti-circumvention laws, then those countries would shut down any tech entrepreneurs who posed a competitive threat to America's metastasizing, inbred tech giants, and the people in those countries would be easy pickings for America's tech giants as they plundered the world's cash and data. Right from the start, the US Trade Rep targeted Canada for these demands. The only problem was that Canadians hated anti-circumvention law. We'd had a front row seat to all the ways that our American cousins were getting fleeced by their tech companies, and we had no desire to share their plight. Plus, we've got some smart nerds here who could easily see themselves exporting very lucrative tools of technological liberation across the southern border. Hell, if we can supply America with reasonably priced pharmaceuticals through the mails, then we can surely sell them excellent anti-ripoff mods over the internet. Paul Martin's Liberals took two runs at passing anti-circumvention law but failed hard. The architect of this project, a Toronto MP named Sam Bulte lost her seat over it, and the Liberal brand became so toxic in Parkdale-High Park that the seat flipped to the NDP for a generation. Then it was Stephen Harper's turn. First, he tasked Jim Prentice with getting an anti-circumvention law through Parliament, and when Prentice failed, Harper turned to Industry Minister Tony Clement and Heritage Minister James Moore with getting the ball over the line. Clement and Moore tried to rehabilitate the idea of anti-circumvention with a public consultation: \"See? We're listening!\" Boy, did that backfire. 6,138 of us wrote into the consultation to condemn the proposal. 53 Vichy nerds wrote in to support it. Moore was clearly stung. Shortly after the consultation, he gave a keynote to the International Chamber of Commerce meeting in Toronto, where he dismissed all 6,138 of us as \"babyish&#8230;radical extremists.\" Then Harper whipped his caucus and passed Bill C-11, The Copyright Modernization Act, in 2012, pasting America's anti-circumvention law into our lawbooks. Now, I don't think that Moore and Clement were particularly motivated by their love of digital locks. Nor was Stephen Harper. Rather, they were under threat from the US Trade Representative, who told them that America would whack us with tariffs if we failed to arrange a hospitable environment for America's tech companies. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but Trump whacked us with tariffs anyway. When someone threatens to burn your house down unless you do as you're told, and they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep taking their orders. Indeed, you're a sucker if you do. In the 15 years since we capitulated to America's policy demands, US Big Tech has grown too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care. To Canada's credit, we've tried a bunch of things to rein in Big Tech: We tried to get them to pay to link to the news (instead, they just blocked all Canadian news); We tried to get them to include Canadian content in their streaming libraries (they lobbied, sued and bullied their way out of it); We tried to make them pay a 3% tax, despite the fiction that all their profits are floating in a state of untaxable grace in the Irish Sea (and they got Trump to terrify Carney into walking it back). This is the \"too big to jail\" part. When a company is a couple orders of magnitude larger than your government, what hope do you have of regulating it? Back a couple years ago, when America's antitrust regulators were also riding Big Tech's ass, there was a chance that we could make a rule and they would help us make it stick. But now that the CEOs of all the Big Tech companies personally gave the Trump campaign a million bucks each for a seat on the inauguration dais, and now that all the tech giants have donated millions to Trump's new Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House, and now that Apple CEO Tim Cook has assembled a gilded participation trophy for Trump on camera, we've got no hope of getting Big Tech to colour inside the lines. So what are we to do? Well, we could continue with our current response to the Trump tariffs. You know: retaliatory tariffs, where we make everything Canadians buy more expensive, because Canadians are famous for just loving it when their prices go up. This is a great way to punish Trump. It's like punching ourselves in the face as hard as we can, and hoping the downstairs neighbour says \"ouch.\" But there's another way: now that we're living with the tariffs we were promised we could avoid by passing an anti-circumvention law, why don't we get rid of that law? There is so much money waiting for us if we go into business disenshittifying America's defective tech products. Take just one example: app stores. Apple takes 30 cents out of every dollar that an Apple user spends in an app. If your app tries to use another payment method, they'll turf it out of the App Store. And of course, iPhone owners can't replace Apple's app store with another one, because the iPhone has an \"access control,\" so it's a crime to change your app store. 30% is an insane transaction rake. I mean, here in Canada, we make person-to-person payments for free. Visa &#8211; an enshittified monopolist if ever there was one &#8211; charges 3-5%. Apple charges Thirty. Percent. Do you have any idea how lucrative this is? It is literally the most lucrative line of business Apple is in. It makes Apple more pure profit than any other line of business, even more than the $20b cash bribe Google pays them every year not to make a competing search engine. $20b is chump-change. Apple makes one hundred billion dollars a year on this racket. They impose a 30% tax on the whole digital economy, and they get to self-preference. So if you want to sell ebooks or videos on an app, Apple charges you 30%, but when Apple sells ebooks and videos on its own apps, it doesn't charge itself 30%. And they get to structure the market. They can exclude any app they want, for any reason, and then no Apple customer in the world can have that app. Last fall, Apple banned an app called \"ICE Block.\" That's an app that warns you if there are ICE thugs nearby, so you can avoid getting kidnapped and sent to a Salvadoran slave-labor camp or shot in the face by a guy with a Waffen SS tattoo under his plate carrier and a mask over his nose. Apple classed ICE murderers as a \"protected class\" and yanked the app. So imagine for a sec that Canada repealed Bill C-11, belatedly heeding the advice of those 6,138 people who wrote into James Moore and Tony Clement's consultation to warn them, basically, that this was going to happen. When that happens, some smart Waterloo grads, backed by some RIM money, can go into business making jailbreaking kits and app store infrastructure for iPhones, and they can sell these to everyone in the world who wants to operate their own app store, who wants to compete with Apple. Offer the world a 90% discount on Apple's app tax, and you're talking about a ten billion dollar/year business. Maybe Canada will never have another RIM, but RIM had a tough business. They had to make hardware, which is risky and capital intensive. Legalize jailbreaking and we can let Apple make the hardware, and then we can cream off the hundred billion dollars in rents they book every year. That's a much better business to be in. You know what Jeff Bezos said to a roomful of publishers when he started Amazon? \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" But these guys are such crybabies. When they do it to us it's progress; when we do it to them, it's piracy. I mean, come on. Elbows up, right? Move fast and break their things. Move fast and break kings. You know all that stuff we failed to get Big Tech to do? Pay for news, put cancon in their streaming lineups? This is how we get it. We can't make Apple or Google or Netflix change their software. We can fine 'em, sure, but Trump will just order his judges not to issue court orders when we try to collect, and ban his banks from transferring the money. In any game, the ref has to be more powerful than the players on the field. Otherwise, they'll do exactly what Big Tech has done to us: ignore our rulings and keep on cheating. We don't have any hope of controlling what Big Tech does, but there is one thing we have total, absolute control over: what we do. We don't have to let American companies make use of our courts to shut down Canadian companies that disenshittify their defective products. The laws of Canada are under total and final Canadian control. Repeal Bill C-11, legalize jailbreaking, and we'll unshackle our technologists and entrepreneurs, and sic 'em on those subpar American products. Meta takes the news out of its apps? Let 'em! We'll just start selling a multiprotocol alt-client, one that merges your Facebook, Insta, Twitter, Linkedin, Bluesky, and Mastodon feeds, blocks all the ads, blocks all the tracking, and puts the news back in your feed. Netflix won't put Canadian media in their library? Fine! We'll start selling an alt client that lets Canadians search and stream from all the services they subscribe to, and adds in a PVR so you can record your favourite shows to watch later, or archive against the day that the streaming company ditches them. A video recorder would handily delete Amazon Prime's grinchiest scam, where all the Christmas specials move from the free tier to $3.99 rentals in November, and go back into the free tier in March. Just record the kids' most beloved Christmas specials in July and bring 'em out in December. Think about this for a second: we uninvented the VCR. The VCR, one of the most popular, transformative technologies in modern history. A wildly profitable technology, too. Once all the video went digital, and once all the digital video threw in an \"access control\" that blocked recording, it became a crime to record digital cable, satellite, or streaming, unless you used the service's own PVR, which won't let you tape some shows, or skip ads, and which deletes your stored shows when the broadcaster decides you don't deserve to have them anymore. It's not illegal to record a video stream, no more than it was illegal to record a TV show off your analog cable or broadcast receiver. The same fair dealing exemptions apply. But because it's illegal to bypass an access control, and the access control blocks recording, we uninvented the VCR. We made the VCR illegal. Not because Parliament ever passed a law banning VCRs, but because our anti-circumvention law allows dominant corporations to simply decide that certain conduct that they disprefer should no longer occur. With Bill C-11, we've created \"felony contempt of business model.\" In living memory, video recording changed the world and made billions of dollars. Today, we've all lost our video recorders. But we have more reason than ever to want a video recorder; to pay for a video recorder. There's fantastic amounts of money just sitting there on the table, money we've prohibited our entrepreneurs from making, in order to prevent the US from hitting us with the tariffs that they've just hit us with. Let's be clear here: no one has the right to a profit. If you've got a business that sucks, and I make it not suck anymore, and your customers start paying me instead of you, well, that sounds like a you problem to me. I mean, does the Canadian government really want to decide which desirable products can and can't exist? Look, I've mainlined Tommy Douglas since I was in red diapers, but that sounds pretty commie, even to me. Which brings me to Canada's own sclerotic, monopoly-heavy commercial environment. After all, Canada is two monopolists and a mining company in a trenchcoat. Which is not to say that our oligarchs are weak. They love to throw their weight around. I guess owning an entire maritime province can go to your head. Will any of these guys step up to cape for America's tech giants? Do any of them benefit from our voluntary decision to let America walk all over us? Not really. But a little, at the margins. Guys like Ted Rogers make a lot of money by making us rent set-top boxes for our cable, which lock out recorders. Re-invent the VCR and Ted Rogers might have to sell his ivory-handled back-scratcher collection. But let him squawk! He can afford the loss, and lest we forget, Ted Rogers made his second fortune renting us video cassettes to stick in our VCRs. When he did it, it was progress. If we do it to him, that's not piracy. Man, there is so much money to be made by becoming the disenshittification nation. It's not just payments or video recorders. One of the main uses of access controls is blocking generic consumables, like inkjet ink. Parliament never made a law saying that people who buy a printer from HP have to buy their ink from HP, too. But because we made it illegal to bypass an access control, and because HP uses access controls to block generic ink, it's a felony to use cheap ink in your own printer. The cartel of four giant inkjet companies know they have us trapped, and they have monotonically raised and raised and raised the price of ink, so that today, printer ink is the most expensive fluid a civilian can purchase without a government permit. At $10,000 per gallon, it would be cheaper to print your grocery lists with the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion. Some smart Canadian technologists could buy every make and model of every printer, and prepare a library of jailbreaks that works across every one, and keep it up to date with every new software update as soon as it's pushed. Everyone in the world who wants to refill ink cartridges or manufacture generics could pay that company $25/month for access to the jailbreaking library and for support if a customer ran into a problem. Every manic entrepreneur running a corner store with a Bitcoin ATM, knife-sharpening and Amazon parcel dropoff could add inkjet ink to their line of business. Multiply every guy with a folding table at a dry-cleaner who'll fix your phone or jailbreak your printer by $25/month, by 12 months/year, and you've got tens or hundreds of millions flowing into this country. We would transform HP's billions into our millions, and the rest would be shared among the world's printer owners as a consumer surplus and freedom from a scummy rent-seeking racket. There's more! Every mechanic is paying $10,000 per manufacturer per year for the diagnostic tool that decrypts the messages on your car's CAN bus and turns your \"check engine\" light into an actual error, and you'd better bet your mechanic is passing that cost onto you. Canadian car hackers can buy every make and model of every car as it comes off the line, jailbreak it, and keep it jailbroken with every new over-the-air update, and sell every mechanic in the world a $50/month subscription to a bang up to date diagnostic tool. The mechanic wins. The drivers win. Canada wins. The Big Three automakers eat dirt, which is fine. Looks like we're buying Chinese cars from now on, anyway, and Parliament never passed a law guaranteeing perpetual profitability to legacy automakers whose most innovative ideas consist of finding ways to rent you the accelerator pedal in your car, and new markets to sell the driving data they steal from you. All kinds of devices can't be fixed because of our anti-circumvention law, Bill C-11. You've probably heard about the problems farmers have fixing their John Deere tractors. Farmers actually do the repairs on those tractors, installing the parts themselves, but the tractor's main computer will not activate those parts until the farmer pays a couple hundred bucks for a callout by a John Deere rep, who enters an unlock code that tells the tractor that John Deere got paid for this repair. Farmers have been fixing their implements since prehistory. Since the invention of the plow. Beamish is Europe's largest open-air museum, just outside of Newcastle. Here we'd call it a \"pioneer village.\" They've rescued and relocated a whole Victorian village high street, an Edwardian colliery and workers' cottages, vehicles from all eras of British history, and they've got a farmhouse that sits on a Roman foundation. That farmhouse has a forge. Because of course it does. Farmers have to be able to fix their stuff, because when the storm is coming, and you need to get the crops in, you can't wait for a service technician to find their way to the end of your lonely country road. But John Deere has declared an end of history, and our Copyright Modernization Act let them do it. Farmers can't fix their tractors anymore, not because Parliament ever passed the \"No Fixing Your Tractor Act.\" They didn't need to. They just passed an act that banned circumvention of access controls, which lets John Deere &#8211; and other rapacious American monopolists &#8211; conjure new felonies out of thin air. There's that \"felony contempt of business model\" again. At this point you might be thinking, \"Hold on a sec, didn't Trudeau whip his caucus to get a Right to Repair bill through Parliament in 2024?\" You're right, he did: Bill C-244. It lets anyone fix anything&#8230;unless they have to bypass an access control in order to make the repair, in which case Bill C-11 makes that repair illegal. Canada's got a Right to Repair law that's big, bold, ambitious&#8230;and useless, a mere ornament, thanks to our anti-circumvention law, which we passed because the US promised us tariff-free access to US markets, a promise that the US has broken, and that we should never believe again. Everything we've tried to do to make Canada safe for US tech exports has failed. They've failed because they're redistributive. We told them they could keep stealing money from our news companies so long as they gave some of it back. We told them they could keep stealing money from people who need to fix their property so long as they follow some rules. We told them they could keep stealing money from our market participants so long as they mixed some cancon in with their streaming libraries. Even our privacy laws are redistributive: sure, go on stealing Canadians' data, just promise to limit the ways you abuse it to a short list of permissible human rights violations. You know what's better than redistribution? Predistribution. Rather than bargaining to recoup some of the value being stripmined from us, we can intervene technologically to prevent the theft in the first place: jailbreak our devices, abolish the app tax, block their monopoly ad insertions and replace them with open ad markets based on content, not surveillance, give users control over the media in their streaming libraries. Let Canadian businesses disenshittify our phones, TVs, tractors, cars and ventilators so anyone can fix them. Ask any economist and they'll tell you that the very best strategy is to have an open, fair system in the first place. Rather than tolerating and even enshrining unfairness in the system, and then begging the beneficiaries of that unfairness to dribble a few crumbs to the hungry victims at their feet. Perhaps all of this is unconvincing to you. Maybe you're not interested in our digital rights. Maybe you're not excited by the prospect of turning America's trillions into Canada's billions. Well, don't worry, I've got something for you, too: national security. Trump has made it clear that America no longer has allies or trading partners, it only has rivals and adversaries. He's also made it clear that he cannot be mollified. Any concessions we make to him will be treated as a sign of weakness, and an invitation to demand more. Give him an inch, he'll take a kilometer. Give him an inch, he'll take Greenland. This is undeniably scary, because Trump has lots of non-kinetic options for pursuing his geopolitical aims. First among them is attacking his adversaries through his tech companies. He's already started tinkering with this. When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the genocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump went through the roof, and Microsoft obliged him by shutting down the court's access to its documents, emails, calendars and address books. They bricked the court. Now, I should say here that Microsoft denies that they shut down the court to please Trump. They say it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a \"he-said/Clippy-said\" dispute between the human rights defenders at the ICC and the convicted monopolists at Microsoft, I know who I believe. What's more, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he \"couldn't guarantee\" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-centre. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's happening right now. Trump has demonstrated that he will both bully and bribe US companies into doing his bidding. Cross him and he'll put extra tariffs on the inputs you need to import from abroad, he'll take away your key workers' visas and deport them, he'll smack you with pretextual antitrust investigations, and sue you in his personal capacity. But if you capitulate to him, he'll give you no-bid government contracts, and hand you billions to provide surveillance gear and prison camps to help with his programme of ethnic cleansing. The tech companies are up to their eyeballs in Trump's authoritarian takeover of the US. There's no daylight between Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other US tech companies and the Trump regime. You can be certain that if &#8211; when! &#8211; Trump orders these companies to shut down a government ministry (perhaps your ministry) or a corporation (perhaps your corporation) that they will do so. Everyone in the world is waking up to this. In the EU, they've just created a new \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar, and they're busily funding the \"Eurostack,\" a set of open, auditable replacements for US tech silos that can run on EU-based data-centres. But they're about to hit a wall. Because it doesn't matter how great those Eurostack services are. If you can't scrape, virtualize and jailbreak US Big Tech apps, so that you can exfiltrate your data, logs, file histories and permissions, no government ministry or large company can do that work by hand. It will challenge many households, who have entrusted US tech's walled gardens with their financial data, family photos, groupchats, family calendars, and other structures that are not easily ported without cooperation from the tech giants. They are not going to cooperate with a mass exodus from their services. They will do everything they can to impede it. Building the Eurostack without legalizing circumvention is like building housing for East Germans in West Berlin. It doesn't matter how cool those apartments are, they're gonna sit empty until you tear down the wall. And administrative software is just for openers. Remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine? These are permanently connected to John Deere's cloud, which is how the John Deere company was able to trace them to Chechnya, and how they were able to send an over-the-air kill signal to the tractor that permanently bricked them. And yes, I'll freely admit that as a cyberpunk writer, this gives a little frisson of satisfaction. But if you only think about it for 10 seconds, you'll realize that this means that Deere can immobilize any tractor in the world, or pretty much every tractor in Canada (and the rest of our tractors are likely from Massey Ferguson, another US giant also in thrall to Trump that can brick its tractors over the air, too). This is exactly the threat we were warned of if we let Huawei supply our 5G infrastructure. Remember that? That whole \"Two Michaels\" business that we got stuck in when we let the US convince us that Huawei was gonna install landmines in our technological infrastructure? Well, you know how the saying goes: \"Every accusation is a confession.\" But of course, China could brick the Chinese cloud-connected tech in Canada, like our solar inverters and batteries. The good news is that whether you're a US natsec hawk or a China natsec hawk, you have the same path out of this trap. Namely: repealing Bill C-11, and legalizing circumvention so that we can deke out the locked bootloaders on our infrastructure and install open, auditable, transparent firmware on them. Because that is an infinitely more reliable way to render your systems into a known-good state than arresting random executives from giant Chinese companies. And the good news is, everyone else in the world wants this, too, because they're all facing the same risks as we are. So this isn't really a technological project, in the sense of having a bunch of duelling firms all competing to come up with their own proprietary answer to an engineering problem. It's more like a scientific project, in that we should have a commons, a git server filled with auditable, transparent, trustworthy drop-in code for whole classes of devices, from cars to TVs to smart speakers to ventilators to tractors to phone switches, that everyone contributes to and peer reviews. We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in our science. No one gets to keep the math used to calculate the load stresses on the joists holding the roof over our head a secret. We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the characteristics of the alloys in those joists, or even the wires carrying electricity through the walls. We should not tolerate secrecy in how our digital infrastructure works, either. After all, a modern building is just a fancy casemod for a bunch of computers. Take all the computers out of a hospital and it becomes a morgue. There's no secret medical science, and there should be no secret medical code, either. So this is it. This is how we win. Trump has unwittingly recruited three armies to fight to end the enshittocene, the era in which all of our technology has turned to shit. There's the digital rights hippies like me (who've been banging this drum since the 2000s); and then there's the entrepreneurs and investors (eager for a chance to turn America's tech trillions into Canada's tech billions, making Canada into a global tech export powerhouse); and finally, there's the national security hawks (who correctly worry that we are at risk of a kind of cyberwarfare the world has never seen before). Normally, cyberwarfare involves hackers associated with an adversary state breaking into your critical systems, but Microsoft doesn't have to break into your ministry's Office365 and Outlook accounts to spy on you or brick your agencies. They already have root on your servers. For Trump, this is cyberwarfare on the easiest setting imaginable. I started throwing this idea around right after Trump announced his first round of tariffs. There was this Canadian think-tank that was soliciting suggestions for Canadian countermeasures, and I sent them this stuff, and they said, \"Well, that would definitely work, but it'll make Trump really mad at us.\" Which, you know, true. But anything that works will make Trump mad at us. So again, I must fall back on my Canadian heritage here and apologize. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I don't have any empty gestures for us to deploy, only ideas for things that will work. I mean, we can stick with the current plan, our retaliatory tariffs, which make everything we buy from America more expensive, and make us all poorer. That'll do something. Like, it'll certainly impose broad-spectrum pain on a bunch of American producers. If we decide to stop drinking delicious bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky's undrinkable rye, there's gonna be some corn farmer out there in a state that begins and ends with a vowel who'll have trouble making payments on his John Deere tractor. But what did that farmer ever do to us? On the other hand, if we go into business selling everyone in the world (including that farmer) (including our own farmer) reliable, auditable, regulated, transparent drop-in firmware replacement for that tractor, then we free that farmer from the rent-extracting scams that John Deere uses to drain his bank account. And since we remain that guy's customer, maybe he'll side with us against Trump, along with the hundreds of millions of American technology users who we can also set free from the app tax, from commercial surveillance that feeds authoritarian state surveillance, from the repair ripoffs, from ink that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion. They become our champions, too. Because if we legalize jailbreaking, we will limit the blast radius of our counterattack, to the tech barons who each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais and their shareholders, who are not everyday Americans. Everyday Americans have gotten poorer every year for 50 years, thanks to wage stagnation, wage theft, economic bubbles and skyrocketing health, education and housing costs. They'll tell you that most Americans own stock, but the amount of stock the average American holds rounds to zero. Nearly all US stock is held by the richest 10% of Americans &#8211; the ones who are backing Trump and getting rich off Trump &#8211; and legalizing jailbreaking is a targeted strike on just those people, which will only benefit our American cousins, the everyday people who've been abused for generations by these eminently guillotineable plutocrats. Canada is in a good position to do this. We've got motive, means and opportunity, but we're not the only ones. Most of the countries in the world are situated to take advantage of this opportunity, to become the \"disenshittification nation\" that supplies the world with wildly profitable software tools that fix America's defective technology. All it takes is one country defecting. That country gets to reap the benefit &#8211; the billions &#8211; of exporting those tools to the world, while the rest of us only get to enjoy the consumer surplus, the technology that works better and costs us less money and privacy to use. You know how Ireland defected from the world's tax treaties and, through regulatory arbitrage, made billions luring the world's largest companies to establish domicile in Dublin, while depriving the world's tax collectors of trillions? Regulatory arbitrage is the game everyone can play. When a country decides to become the Ireland for disenshittification, the nation where it's legal to jailbreak locked technology, and export the tools to do so to everyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method, they will get to reap the largest benefit. They'll grab the hoarded monopoly rents of America's tech giants and use them as fuel for a single-use rocket that launches their domestic tech sector into a stable orbit for generations. Those American tech companies need to be relieved of the dead capital on their balance sheets. What are these companies doing with their looted trillions? Blowing it all on AI. They tell you there's a lot of money to be made with AI, but no one can tell you where it's going to come from. This month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he's going to recoup the hundreds of billions of dollars he's pissed away on AI by turning Google into the world's perfect engine for surveillance pricing. That's when a company uses surveillance data to predict how desperate you are, and jacks up the price to the highest amount they think they can get you to part with. This is a terrible idea of course, but it's not just terrible in the sense of \"this is an idea Google should be ashamed of.\" It's terrible in the sense of \"this won't work because everyone will hate it and refuse to participate in it.\" It's just another harebrained scheme to finally find a way to make AI profitable, or at least less unprofitable. Compare that with my anti-circumvention plan. I can tell you exactly where the money in my plan is going to come from: it's just sitting there on Big Tech's balance sheets, waiting for us to go get it. We'll make money by making products that people want, because it will make their tech better, and they will pay us for them. I mean, I know that sounds old-fashioned. But what can I say? Sometimes, the old ways are best. If there's one thing Canada is good at, it's going to other countries and digging up all their wealth. America's tech giants have buried trillions of dollars they stole from the world, and we know exactly where it is. What's more, we can dig it out from here. No travel required! Let's go get it. Their margin is our opportunity.

    "summary": "<p>In case you haven’t been following the world of software development closely, it’s good to know that vibe coding — using LLM tools to assist with writing code — can help enable many people to create apps or software that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to make. This has led to an extraordinarily rapid adoption curve amongst even experienced coders in many different disciplines within the world of coding. But there’s a very important threat posed by vibe coding that almost no one has been talking about, one that’s far more insidious and specific than just the risks and threats posted by AI or LLMs in general.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p>\n<p><em>One of the most effective uses of LLMs is in helping programmers write code</em> A huge reason VCs and tech tycoons put billions into funding LLMs was so they could undermine coders and depress wages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vibe coding might limit us to making simpler apps instead of the radical innovation we need to challenge Big Tech</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start vibing</h2>\n<p>It may be useful to start by explaining how people use LLMs to assist with writing software. My background is that I’ve helped build multiple companies focused on enabling millions of people to create with code. And I’m personally an example of one common scenario with vibe coding. Since I don’t code regularly anymore, I’ve become much slower and less efficient at even the web development tasks that I used to do professionally, which I used to be fairly competent at performing. In software development, there are usually a nearly-continuous stream of new technologies being released (like when you upgrade your phone, or your computer downloads an update to your web browser), and when those things change, developers have to update <em>their</em> skills and knowledge to stay current with the latest tools and techniques. If you’re not staying on top of things, your skillset can rapidly decay into irrelevance, and it can be hard to get back up to speed, even though you understand the fundamentals completely, and the underlying logic of <em>how</em> to write code hasn’t changed at all. It’s like knowing how to be an electrician but suddenly you have to do all your work in French, and you don’t speak French.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of problem that LLMs are really good at helping with. Before I had this kind of coding assistant, I couldn’t do any meaningful projects within the limited amount of free time that I have available on nights and weekends to build things. Now, with the assistance of contemporary tools, I can get help with things like routine boilerplate code and obscure syntax, speeding up my work enough to focus on the fun, creative parts of coding that I love.</p>\n<p>Even professional coders who <em>are</em> up to date on the latest technologies use these LLM tools to do things like creating scripts, which are essentially small bits of code used to automate or process common tasks. This kind of code is disposable, meaning it may only ever be run once, and it’s not exposed to the internet, so security or privacy concerns aren’t usually much of an issue. In that context, having the LLM create a utility for you can feel like being truly liberated from grunt work, something like having a robot vacuum around to sweep up the floor.</p>\n<h2>Surfing towards serfdom</h2>\n<p>This all sounds pretty good, right? It certainly helps explain why so many in the tech world tend to see AI much more positively than almost everyone else does; there’s a clear-cut example of people finding value from these tools in a way that feels empowering or even freeing.</p>\n<p>But there are far darker sides to this use of AI. Let me put aside the threats and risks of AI that are true of <em>all</em> uses of the Big AI platforms, like the environmental impact, the training on content without consent, the psychological manipulation of users, the undermining of legal regulations, and other significant harms. These are all real, and profound, but I want to focus on what’s specific to using AI to help write code here, because there are negative externalities that are unique to <em>this</em> context that people haven’t discussed enough. (For more on the larger AI discussion, see &quot;<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/01/what-would-good-ai-look-like/\">What would good AI look like?</a>&quot;)</p>\n<p>The first problem raised by vibe coding is an obvious one: the major tech investors focused on making AI good at writing code because they wanted to make coders less powerful and reduce their pay. If you go back a decade ago, nearly everyone in the world was saying “teach your kids to code” and being a software engineer was one of the highest paying, most powerful individual jobs in the history of labor. Pretty soon, coders were acting like it — using their power to improve workplace conditions for those around them at the major tech companies, and pushing their employers to be more socially responsible. Once workers began organizing in this way, the tech tycoons who founded the big tech companies, and the board members and venture capitalists who backed them, immediately began investing billions of dollars in building these technologies that would devalue the labor of millions of coders around the world.</p>\n<p>It worked. More than <em>half a million</em> tech workers have been laid off in America since ChatGPT was released in November 2022.</p>\n<p>That’s <em>just</em> in the private sector, and <em>just</em> the ones tracked by <a href=\"https://layoffs.fyi\">layoffs.fyi</a>.  Software engineering job listings have <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/\">plummeted to a 5-year low</a>. This is during a period of time that nobody even describes as a recession. The same venture capitalists who funded the AI boom keep insisting that these trends are about macroeconomic abstractions like interest rates, a stark contrast to their rhetoric the rest of the time, when they insist that they are alpha males who make their own decisions based on their strong convictions and brave stances against woke culture. It is, in fact, the case that they are just greedy people who invested a ton of money into trying to put a lot of good people out of work, and they succeeded in doing so.</p>\n<p>There is no reason why AI tools like this <em>couldn't</em> be used in the way that they're often described, where they increase productivity and enable workers to do more and generate more value. But instead we have the wealthiest people in the world telling the wealthiest companies in the world, while they generate record profits, to lay off workers who could be creating cool things for customers, and then blaming it on everyone but themselves.</p>\n<h2>The past as prison</h2>\n<p>Then there’s the second problem raised by vibe coding: You can’t make anything truly radical with it. By definition, LLMs are trained on what has come before. In addition to being already-discovered territory, existing code is buggy and broken and sloppy and, as anyone who has ever written code knows, absolutely embarrassing to look at. Worse, many of the people who are using vibe coding tools are increasingly those who <em>don’t</em> understand the code that is being generated by these systems. This means the people generating all of this newly-vibed code won’t even know when the output is insecure, or will perform poorly, or includes exploits that let others take over their system, or when it is simply incoherent nonsense that <em>looks</em> like code but doesn’t do anything.</p>\n<p>All of those factors combine to encourage people to think of vibe coding tools as a sort of “black box” that just spits out an app <em>for</em> you. Even the giant tech companies are starting to encourage this mindset, tacitly endorsing the idea that people don’t need to know what their systems are doing under the hood. But obviously, somebody needs to know whether a system is <em>actually</em> secure. Somebody needs to know if a system is actually doing the tasks it says that it’s doing. The Big AI companies that make the most popular LLMs on the market today routinely design their products to induce emotional dependency in users by giving them positive feedback and encouragement, even when that requires generating false responses. Put more simply: they make the bot lie to you to make you feel good so you use the AI more. That’s terrible in a million ways, but one of them is that it sure does generate some bad code.</p>\n<p>And a vibe coding tool absolutely won’t make something truly <em>new</em>. The most radical, disruptive, interesting, surprising, weird, fun innovations in technology have happened because people with a strange compulsion to do something cool had enough knowledge to get their code out into the world. The World Wide Web itself was <em>not</em> a huge technological leap over what came before — it took off because of a huge leap in <em>insight</em> into human nature and human behavior, that happened to be captured in code. The actual bits and bytes? They were mostly just plain text, much of which was in formats that had already been around for many years prior to Tim Berners-Lee assembling it all into the first web browser. That kind of surprising innovation could probably never be vibe coded, even though all of the raw materials might be scooped up by an LLM, because even if the human writing the prompt had that counterintuitive stroke of genius, the system would still be hemmed in by the constraints of the works it had been trained on. The past is a prison when you’re inventing the future.</p>\n<p>What’s more, if you were going to use a vibe coding tool to make a truly radical new technology, do you think today’s Big AI companies would let their systems create that app? The same companies that made a platform that just put hundreds of thousands of coders out of work? The  same companies that make a platform that tells your kids to end their own lives? The same companies whose cronies in the White House are saying there should <em>never be any laws</em> reining them in? Those folks are going to help you make new tech that threatens to disrupt their power? I don’t think so.</p>\n<h2>Putting power in people’s hands</h2>\n<p>I’m deeply torn about what the future of LLMs for coding should be. I’ve spent decades of my life trying to make it easier for everyone to make software. I’ve seen, firsthand, the power of using AI tools to help coders — especially those new to coding — build their confidence in being able to create something new. I love that potential, and in many ways, it’s the most positive and optimistic possibility around LLMs that I’ve seen. It’s the thing that makes me think that maybe there is a part of all the AI hype that is not pure bullshit. Especially if we can find a version of these tools that’s genuinely open source and free and has been trained on people’s code with their consent and cooperation, perhaps in collaboration with some educational institutions, I’d be delighted to see that shared with the world in a thoughtful way.</p>\n<p>But I also have seen the majority of the working coders I know (and the <em>non</em>-working coders I know, including myself) rush to integrate the commercial coding assistants from the Big AI companies into their workflow without necessarily giving proper consideration to the long-term implications of that choice. What happens when we’ve developed our dependencies on that assistance? How will people introduce <em>new</em> technologies like new programming languages and frameworks if we all consider the LLMs to be the canonical way of writing our code, and the training models don’t know the new tech exists? How does our imagination shrink when we consider our options of what we create with code to be choosing between the outputs of the LLM rather than starting from the blank slate of our imagination? How will we build the next generation of coders skilled enough to catch the glaring errors that LLMs create in their code?</p>\n<p>There’s never been this stark a contrast between the negatives and positives of a new technology being so tightly coupled before when it comes to enabling developers. Generally change comes to coders incrementally. Historically, there was always a (wonderful!) default skepticism to coding culture, where anything that reeked of marketing or hype was looked at with a huge amount of doubt until there was a significant amount of proof to back it up.</p>\n<p>But in recent years, as with everything else, the culture wars have come for tech. There’s now a cohort in the coding world that has adopted a cult of personality around a handful of big tech tycoons despite the fact that these men are deeply corrosive to society. Or perhaps <em>because</em> they are. As a result, there’s a built-in constituency for any new AI tool, regardless of its negative externalities, which gives them a sense of momentum even where there may not be any.</p>\n<p>It’s worth us examining what’s really going on, and articulating explicitly what we’re trying to enable. Who are we trying to empower? What does success look like? What do we want people to be able to build? What do we <em>not</em> want people to be able to make? What price is too high to pay? What convenience is not worth the cost?</p>\n<h2>What tools do we choose?</h2>\n<p>I do, still, believe deeply in the power of technology to empower people. I believe firmly that you have to understand how to create technology if you want to understand how to control it. And I still believe that we have to democratize the power to create and control technology to as many people as possible so that technology can be something people can use as a tool, rather than something that happens _to_them.</p>\n<p>We are now in a complex phase, though, where the promise of democratizing access to creating technology is suddenly fraught in a way that it has never been before. The answer can’t possibly be that technology remains inaccessible and difficult for those outside of a privileged class, and easy for those who are already comfortable in the existing power structure.</p>\n<p>A lot is still very uncertain, but I come back to one key question that helps me frame the discussion of what’s next: What’s the most radical app that we could build? And which tools will enable me to build it? Even if all we can do is start having a more complicated conversation about what we’re doing when we’re vibe coding, we’ll be making progress towards a more empowered future.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>It’s absolutely vital to be able to communicate effectively and efficiently to large groups of people. I’ve been lucky enough to get to refine and test my skills in communicating at scale for a few decades now, and the power of talking to communities is the one area where I’d most like to pass on what I’ve learned, because it’s this set of skills that can have the biggest effect on deciding whether good ideas and good work can have their greatest impact.</p>\n<p>My own work crosses many disparate areas. Over the years, I’ve gotten to cycle between domains as distinct as building technology platforms and products for developers and creators, enabling activism and policy advocacy in service of humanist ideals, and more visible external-facing work such as public speaking or writing in various venues like magazines or on this site. (And then sometimes I dabble in my other hobbies and fun stuff like scholarship or research into areas like pop culture and media.)</p>\n<p>What’s amazing is, in <em>every single one</em> of these wildly different areas, the exact same demands apply when trying to communicate to broad groups of people. This is true despite the broadly divergent cultural norms across all of these different disciplines. It can be a profoundly challenging, even intimidating, job to make sure a message is being communicated accurately, and in high fidelity, to everyone that you need to reach.</p>\n<p>That vital task of communicating to a large group gets even <em>more</em> daunting when you inevitably realize that, even if you <em>were</em> to find the perfect wording or phrasing for your message, you’d still never be able to deliver your story to every single person in your target audience by yourself anyway. There will always be another person whom you’re trying to reach that you just haven’t found yet. So, is it hopeless? Is it simply impossible to effectively tell a story at scale if you don’t have massive resources?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be. We can start with one key insight about what it takes to get your most important stories out into the world. It’s a perspective that seems incredibly simple at first, but can lead to a pretty profound set of insights.</p>\n<h2>They have to be able to talk about us <em>without us</em>.</h2>\n<p>They have to be able to talk about us without us. What this phrase means, in its simplest form,  is that you have to tell a story so clear, so concise, so <em>memorable and evocative</em> that people can repeat it for you even after you’ve left the room. And the people who hear it need to be able to do this the <em>first time</em> they hear the story. Whether it’s the idea behind a new product, the core promise of a political campaign, or the basic takeaway from a persuasive essay (guess what the point of this one is!) — not only do you have to explain your idea and make your case, you have to be teaching your listener how to do the same thing for themselves.</p>\n<p>This is a tall order, to be sure. In pop music, the equivalent is writing a hit where people feel like they can sing along to the chorus by the time they get to the end of the song for the first time. Not everybody has it in them to write a hook that good, but if you do, that thing is going to become a classic. And when someone <em>else</em> has done it, you know it because it gets stuck in your head. Sometimes you end up humming it to yourself even if you didn’t want to. Your best ideas — your most <em>vital</em> ideas — need to rest on a messaging platform that solid.</p>\n<p>Delivering this kind of story actually requires substance. If you’re trying to fake it, or to force a narrative out of fluff or fakery, that will very immediately become obvious. When you set out to craft a story that travels in your absence, it has to have a body if it’s going to have legs. Bullshit is slippery and smells terrible, and the first thing people want to do when you leave the room is run away from it, not carry it with them.</p>\n<h2>The mission is the message</h2>\n<p>There’s another challenge to making a story that can travel in your absence: your ego has to let that happen. If you make a story that is effective and compelling enough that others can tell it, then, well…. those other people are going to tell it.  Not you. They’ll do it in their own words, and in their own voices, and make it <em>theirs</em>. They may use a similar story, but in their own phrasing, so it will resonate better with their people. This is a <em>gift</em>! They are doing you a kindness, and extending you great generosity. Respond with gratitude, and be wary of anyone who balks at not getting to be the voice or the face of a message themselves. Everyone gets a turn telling the story.</p>\n<p>Maybe the simple fact that others will be hearing a good story for the first time will draw them to it, regardless of <em>who</em> the messenger is. Sometimes people get attached to the idea that <em>they</em> have to be the one to deliver the one true message. But a core precept of “talk about us without us” is that there’s a larger mission and goal that everyone is bought into, and this demands that everyone stay aligned to their values rather than to their own personal ambitions around who tells the story.</p>\n<p>The truth of whomever will be most <em>effective</em> is the factor used to decide who will be the person to tell the story in any context. And this is a forgiving environment, because even if someone doesn’t get to be the voice one day, they’ll get another shot, since repetition and consistency are also key parts of this strategy, thanks to the disciplined approach that it brings to communication.</p>\n<h2>The joy of communications discipline</h2>\n<p>At nearly every organization where I’ve been in charge of onboarding team members in the last decade or so, one of the first messages we’ve presented to our new colleagues is, “We are disciplined communicators!” It’s a message that they hopefully get to hear as a joyous declaration, and as an assertion of our shared values. I always try to explicitly instill this value into teams I work with because, first, it’s good to communicate values explicitly, but also because this is a concept that is very seldom directly stated.</p>\n<p>It is ironic that this statement usually goes unsaid, because nearly everyone who pays attention to culture understands the vital importance of disciplined communications. Brands that are strictly consistent in their use of things like logos, type, colors, and imagery get such wildly-outsized cultural impact in exchange for relatively modest investment that it’s mind-boggling to me that more organizations don’t insist on following suit. Similarly, institutions that develop and strictly enforce a standard tone of voice and way of communicating (even if the tone itself is playful or casual) capture an incredibly valuable opportunity at minimal additional cost relative to how much everyone’s already spending on internal and external communications.</p>\n<p>In an era where every channel is being flooded with AI-generated slop, and when most of the slop tools are woefully incapable of being consistent about anything, simply showing up with an obviously-human, obviously-consistent story is a phenomenal way of standing out. That discipline demonstrates all the best of humanity: a shared ethos, discerning taste, joyful expression, a sense of belonging, an appealing consistency. And best of all, it represents the chance to participate for yourself — because it’s a message that you now know how to repeat for yourself.</p>\n<p>Providing messages that individuals can pick up and run with on their own is a profoundly human-centric and empowering thing to do in a moment of rising authoritarianism. When the fascists in power are shutting down prominent voices for leveling critiques that they would like to censor, and demanding control over an increasingly broad number of channels, there’s reassurance in people being empowered to tell their own stories together. Seeing stories bubble up from the grassroots in collaboration, rather than being forced down upon people from authoritarians at the top, has an emotional resonance that only strengthens the substance of whatever story you’re telling.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p>Okay, so it sounds great: Let’s tell stories that other people want to share! Now, uh… how do we do it? There are simple principles we can follow that help shape a message or story into one that is likely to be carried forward by a community on its own.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ground it in your values.</strong> When we began telling the story of my last company Glitch, the conventional wisdom was that we were building a developer tool, so people would describe it as an “IDE” — an “integrated development environment”, which is the normal developer jargon for the tool coders use to write their code in. We <em>never</em> described Glitch that way. From <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170504080445/https://glitch.com/\">day one</a>, we always said “Glitch is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams” (later, “the friendly community where everybody builds the internet”). By talking about the site as a <em>friendly community</em> instead of an <code>integrated development environment</code>, it was crystal clear what expectations and norms we were setting, and what our values were. Within a few months, even our <em>competitors</em> were describing Glitch as a “friendly community” while they were trying to talk about how they were better than us about some feature or the other. That still feels like a huge victory — even the competition was talking about us without us! Make sure your message evokes the values you want people to share with each other, either directly or indirectly.</li>\n<li><strong>Start with the principle.</strong> This is a topic I’ve covered before, but <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2022/01/31/you-have-to-start-with-the-principle/\">you can't win unless you know what you're fighting for</a>. Identify concrete, specific, perhaps even <em>measurable</em> goals that are tied directly to the values that motivate your efforts. As <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/11/05/turn-the-volume-up/\">noted recently</a>, Zohran Mamdani did this masterfully when running for mayor of New York City. While the <em>values</em> were affordability and the dignity of ordinary New Yorkers, the clear, understandable, measurable principle could be something as simple as “free buses”. This is a goal that everyone can get in 5 seconds, and can explain to their neighbor <em>the first time they hear it</em>. It’s a story that travels effortlessly on its own — and that people will be able to verify very easily when it’s been delivered. That’s a perfect encapsulation of “talk about us without us”.</li>\n<li>**Know what makes you unique.**Another way of putting this is to simply make sure that you have a sense of self-awareness. But the story you tell about your work or your movement has to be <em>specific</em>. There can’t be platitudes or generalities or vague assertions as a core part of the message, or it will never take off. One of the most common failure states for this mistake is when people lean on <em>slogans</em>. Slogans can have their use in a campaign, for reminding people about the existence of a brand, or supporting broader messaging. But very often, people think a slogan <em>is</em> a story. The problem is that, while slogans are definitely repeatable, slogans are almost definitionally too vague and broad to offer a specific and unique narrative that will resonate. There’s no point in having people share something if it doesn’t say something. I usually articulate the challenge here like this:<strong>Only say what only <em>you</em> can say.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Be evocative, not comprehensive.</strong> Many times, when people are passionate about a topic or a movement, the temptation they have in telling the story is to work in <em>every little detail</em> about the subject. They often think, “if I include every detail, it will persuade more people, because they’ll know that I’m an expert, or it will convince them that I’ve thought of everything!” In reality, when people are not subject matter experts on a topic, or if they’re not already intrinsically interested in that topic, hearing a bunch of extensive minutia about it will almost always leave them feeling bored, confused, intimidated, condescended-to, or some combination of all of these. Instead, pick a small subset of the most <em>emotionally gripping</em> parts of your story, the aspects that have the deepest human connection or greatest relevance and specificity to the broadest set of your audience, and focus on telling those parts of the story as passionately as possible. If you succeed in communicating that initial small subset of your story effectively, then you may <em>earn</em> the chance to tell the other more complex and nuanced details of your story.</li>\n<li><strong>Your enemies are your friends.</strong> Very often, when people are creating messages about advocacy, they’re focused on competition or rivals. In the political realm, this can be literal opposing candidates, or the abstraction of another political party. In the corporate world, this can be (real or imagined) competitive products or companies. In many cases, these other organizations or products or competitors occupy so much more mental space in your mind, or your team’s mind, than they do in the mind of your potential audience. Some of your audience has never heard of them at all. And a <em>huge</em> part of your audience thinks of you and your biggest rival as… basically the same thing. In a business or commercial context, customers can barely keep straight the difference between you and your competition — you’re both just part of the same amorphous blob that exists as “the things that occupy that space”. Your competitor may be the only other organization in the world that’s fighting just as hard as you are to create a market for the product that you’re selling. The same is true in the political space; sometimes the biggest friction arises over the narcissism of small differences. What we can take away from these perspectives is that our stories have to focus on what distinguishes us, yes, but also on what we might have in common with those whom we might otherwise have perceived to have been aligned with the “enemy”. Those folks might not have sworn allegiance to an opposing force; they may simply have chosen another option out of convenience, and not even seen that choice as being in opposition to your story at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Find joy in repetition.</strong> Done correctly, a disciplined, collaborative, evocative message can become a mantra for a community. There’s a pride and enthusiasm that can come from people becoming proficient in sharing their own version of the collective story. And that means enjoying when that refrain comes back around, or when a slight improvement in the core message is discovered, and everyone finds a way to refine the way they’re communicating about the narrative. A lot of times, people worry that their team will get bored if they’re “just telling the same story over and over all the time”. In reality, as a brilliant man once said, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FgP5VRp_myE\">there’s joy in repetition</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t obsess over exact wording.</strong> This one is tricky; you might say, “but you said we have to be disciplined communicators!” And it’s true: it’s important to be disciplined. But that doesn’t mean you can’t leave room for people to put their own spin on things. Let them translate to their own languages or communities. Let them augment a general principle with a specific, personal connection. If they have their own authentic experience which will amplify a story or drive a point home, let them weave that context into the consistent narrative that’s been shared over time. As long as you’re not enabling a “telephone game” where the story starts to morph into an unrecognizable form, it’s perfectly okay to add a human touch by going slightly off script.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Share the story</h2>\n<p>Few things are more rewarding than when you find a meaningful narrative that resonates with the world. Stories have the power to change things, to make people feel empowered, to galvanize entire communities into taking action and recognizing their own power. There’s also a quiet reward in the craft and creativity of working on a story that travels, in finding notes that resonate with others, and in challenging yourself to get far enough out of your own head to get into someone else’s heart.</p>\n<p>I still have so much to learn about being able to tell stories effectively. I still screw it up so much of the time, and I can look back on many times when I wish I had better words at hand for moments that sorely needed them. But many of the most meaningful and rewarding moments of my life have been when I’ve gotten to be in community with others, as we were not just sharing stories together, but <em>telling</em> a united story together. It unlocks a special kind of creativity that’s a lot bigger than what any one of us can do alone.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>As I was drafting my last piece on Friday, “<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/\">They have to be able to talk about us without us</a>”, my thoughts of course went to one of the most famous slogans of the disability rights movement, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_about_us_without_us\">Nothing about us without us.</a>” I wasn’t unaware that there were similarities in the phrasing of what I wrote. But I think the topic of communicating effectively to groups, as I wrote about the other day, and ensuring that disabled people are centered in disability advocacy, are such different subjects that I didn’t want to just quickly gloss over the topic in a sidebar of a larger piece. They're very distinct topics that really only share a few words in common.</p>\n<p>One of the great joys of becoming friends with a number of really thoughtful and experienced disability rights activists over the last several years has been their incredible generosity in teaching me about so much of the culture and history of the movements that they’ve built their work upon, and one of the most powerful slogans has been that refrain of “nothing about us without us”.</p>\n<p>Here I should start by acknowledging Alice Wong, who we recently lost, who founded the <a href=\"https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/about/\">Disability Visibility Project</a>, and a MacArthur Fellow, and a tireless and inventive advocate for everyone in the disabled community. She was one of the first people to bring me in to learning about this history and these movements, more than a decade ago. She was also a patient and thoughtful teacher, and over our many conversations over the years, she did more than anyone else in my life to truly <em>personify</em> the spirit of “nothing about us without us” by fighting to ensure that disabled people led the work to make the world accessible for all. If you have the chance, learn about her work, and <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/Alice-Wongs-Legacy\">support it</a>.</p>\n<p>But a key inflection point in my own understanding of “nothing about us without us” came, unsurprisingly, in the context of how disabled people have been interacting with technology. I used to host a podcast called Function, and we did an episode about how inaccessible so much of contemporary technology has become, and how that kind of ruins things for everyone. (The episode is still up on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0IN2nQWUqmQnAMxNLN85WE\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/function-with-anil-dash/id1439658455?i=1000452883786\">Apple Podcasts</a>.)  We had on <a href=\"https://emilyladau.com\">Emily Ladau</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theaccessiblestall.com\">The Accessible Stall</a> podcast, <a href=\"https://alexhaagaard.com\">Alex Haagaard</a> of <a href=\"https://www.disabledlist.org\">The Disabled List</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vilissathompson.com\">Vilissa Thompson</a> of <a href=\"https://www.rampyourvoice.com\">Ramp Your Voice</a>. It’s well worth a listen, and Emily, Alex and Vilissa really do an amazing job of pointing to really specific, really evocative examples of <em>obvious</em> places where today’s tech world could be so much more useful and powerful for everyone if its creators were making just a few simple changes.</p>\n<p>What’s striking to me now, listening to that conversation six years later, is how little has changed from the perspective of the technology world, but also how much my own lived experience has come to reflect so much of what I learned in those conversations.</p>\n<p>Each of them was the &quot;us&quot; in the conversation, using their own personal experience, and the experience of other disabled people that they were in community with, to offer specific and personal insights that the creators of these technologies did not have. And whether it was for reasons of crass commercial opportunism — here's some money you could be making! — or simply because it was the right thing to do morally, it's obvious that the people making these technologies could benefit by honoring the principle of centering these users of their products.</p>\n<h2>Taking our turn</h2>\n<p>I’ve had this conversation on various social media channels in a number of ways over the years, but another key part of understanding the “us” in “nothing about us without us” when it comes to disability, is that the “us” is <em>all of us</em>, in time. It's very hard for many people who haven’t experienced it to understand that everyone should be accommodated and supported, because everyone is disabled; it’s only a question of when and for how long.</p>\n<p>In contemporary society, we’re given all kinds of justifications for why we can’t support everyone’s needs, but so much of those are really grounded in simply trying to convince ourselves that a disabled person is <em>someone else</em>, an “other” who isn’t worthy or deserving of our support. I think deep down, everyone knows better. It’s just that people who don’t (yet) identify as disabled don’t really talk about it very much.</p>\n<p>In reality, we'll all be disabled. Maybe you're in a moment of respite from it, or in that brief window before the truth of the inevitability of it has been revealed to you (sorry, spoiler warning!), but it's true for all of us — even when it's not visible. That means all of us have to default to supporting and uplifting and empowering the people who are disabled today. This was the key lesson that I didn’t really get personally until I started listening to those who were versed in the history and culture of disability advocacy, about how the patronizing solutions were often harmful, or competing for resources with the <em>right</em> answers.</p>\n<p>I’ve had my glimpses of this myself. Back in 2021, I had Lyme disease. I didn’t get it as bad as some, but it did leave me physically and mentally unable to function as I had been used to, for several months. I had some frame of reference for physical weakness; I could roughly compare it to a bad illness like the flu, even if it wasn’t exactly the same. But a diminished <em>mental</em> capacity was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and was profoundly unsettling, deeply challenging my sense of self. After the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2022/07/18/i-went-to-a-coffee-shop/\">incident I’d described in 2022</a>, I had a series of things to recover from physically and mentally that also presented a significant challenge, but were especially tough because so much of people’s willingness to accommodate others is based on any disability being <em>visible</em>. Anything that’s not immediately perceived at a superficial level, or legible to a stranger in a way that’s familiar to them, is generally dismissed or seen as invalid for support.</p>\n<p>I point all of this out not to claim that I fully understand the experience of those who live with truly serious disabilities, or to act as if I know what it’s been like for those who have genuinely worked to advocate for disabled people. Instead, I think it can often be useful to show how porous the boundary is between people who <em>don’t</em> think of themselves as disabled and those who already know that they are. And of course this does <em>not</em> mean that people who aren't currently disabled can speak on behalf of those who are — that's the whole point of &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;! — but rather to point out that the time to begin building your empathy and solidarity is now, not when you suddenly have the realization that you're part of the community.</p>\n<h2>Everything about us</h2>\n<p>There’s a righteous rage that underlies the cry of “nothing about us without us”, stemming from so many attempts to address the needs of disabled people having come from those outside the community, arriving with plans that ranged from inept to evil. We’re in a moment when the authoritarians in charge in so much of the world are pushing openly-eugenicist agendas that will target disabled people first amongst the many vulnerable populations that they’ll attempt to attack. Challenging economic times like the one we’re in affect disabled people significantly harder as the job market disproportionately shrinks in opportunities for the disabled first.</p>\n<p>So it’s going to take all of us standing in solidarity to ensure that the necessary advocacy and support are in place for what promises to be an extraordinarily difficult moment. But I take some solace and inspiration from the fact that there are so many disabled people who have provided us with the clear guidance and leadership we need to navigate this moment. And there is simple guidance we can follow when doing so to ensure that we’re centering the right leaders, by listening to those who said, “nothing about us without us.”</p>",

    "link": "https://anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/",
    "summary": "<p>The number one question I get from my friends, acquaintances, and mentees in the technology industry these days is, by far, variations on the basic theme of, “what the hell are we supposed to do now?”</p>\n<p>There have been mass layoffs that leave more tech workers than ever looking for new roles in the worst market we’ve ever seen. Many of the most talented, thoughtful and experienced people in the industry are feeling worried, confused, and ungrounded in a field that no longer looks familiar.</p>\n<p>If you’re outside the industry, you may be confused — isn’t there an AI boom that’s getting hundreds of billions of dollars in investments? Doesn’t that mean the tech bros are doing great? What you may have missed is that half a million tech workers have been laid off in the years since ChatGPT was released; the same attacks on marginalized workers and DEI and “woke” that the tech robber barons launched against the rest of society were aimed at their own companies first.</p>\n<p>So the good people who actually <em>make</em> the technology we use every day, the real innovators and creators and designers, are reacting to the unprecedented disconnect between the contemporary tech industry and the fundamentals that drew so many people toward it in the first place. Many of the biggest companies have abandoned the basic principle of making technology that actually <em>works</em>. So many new products fail to deliver on even the basic capabilities that the companies are promising that they will provide.</p>\n<p>Many leaders at these companies have run full speed towards moral and social cowardice, abandoning their employees and customers to embrace rank hatred and discrimination in ways that they pretended to be fighting against just a few years ago. Meanwhile, unchecked consolidation has left markets wildly uncompetitive, leaving consumers suffering from the effects of categories without any competition or investment — which we know now as “enshittification”. And the full-scale shift into corruption and crony capitalism means that winners in business are decided by whoever is shameless enough to offer the biggest bribes and debase themselves with the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/\">most humiliating display</a> of groveling. It’s a depressing shift for people who, earlier in their careers, often actually <em>were</em> part of inventing the future.</p>\n<p>So where do we go from here?</p>\n<h2>You’re not crazy.</h2>\n<p>The first, and most important, thing to know is that <em>it’s not just you</em>. Nearly everyone in tech I have this conversation with feels very isolated about it, and they’re often embarrassed or ashamed to discuss it. They think that everyone else who has a job in tech is happy or comfortable at their current employers, or that the other people looking for work are getting calls back or are being offered interviews in response to their job applications. But I’m here to tell you: it is grim right now. About as bad as I’ve seen. And I’ve been around a long time.</p>\n<p>Every major tech company has watched their leadership abandon principles that were once thought sacrosanct. I’ve heard more people talk about losing respect for executives they trusted, respected, even <em>admired</em> in the last year than at any time I can remember. In smaller companies and other types of organizations, the challenges have been more about the hard choices that come from dire resource constraints or being forced to make ugly ethical compromises for pragmatic reasons. The net result is tons of people who have lost pride and conviction in their work. They’re going through the motions for a paycheck, because they know it’s a tough job market out there, which is a miserable state of affairs.</p>\n<p>The public narrative is dominated by the loud minority of dudes who are content to appease the egos of their bosses, sucking up to the worse impulses of those in charge. An industry that used to pride itself on publicly reporting security issues and openly disclosing vulnerabilities now circles its wagons to gang up on people who suggest that an AI tool shouldn’t tell children to harm themselves, that perhaps it should be possible to write a law limiting schools from deploying AI platforms that are known to tell kids to end their own lives. People in tech endure their bosses using slurs at work, making jokes about sexual assault, consorting with leaders who have directly planned the murder of journalists, engaging in open bribery in blatant violation of federal law and their own corporate training on corruption, and have to act like it’s normal.</p>\n<p>But it’s not the end of the world. The forces of evil have not yet triumphed, and all hope is not lost. There are still things we can do.</p>\n<h2>Taking back control</h2>\n<p>It can be easy to feel overwhelmed at such an unprecedented time in the industry, especially when there’s so much change happening. But there are concrete actions you can take to have agency over your own career, and to insulate yourself from the bad actors and maximize your own opportunities — even if some of those bad actors are your own bosses.</p>\n<h3>Understanding systems</h3>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do is to be clear about your own place, and your own role, within the systems that you are part of. A major factor in the changes that bosses are trying to effect with the deployment of AI is shifting the role of workers within the systems in their organization to make them more replaceable.</p>\n<p>If you’re a coder, and you think your job is to make really good code in a particular programming language, you might double down on getting better at the details of that language. But that’s almost certainly misunderstanding the system that your company thinks you’re part of, where the code is just a means to the end of creating a final product. In that system-centric view, the programming language, and indeed all of the code itself, doesn’t really matter; the person who is productive at causing all of that code to be created reliably and efficiently is the person who is going to be valued, or at least who is most likely to be kept around. That may not be satisfying or reassuring if you truly love coding, but at least this perspective can help you make informed decisions about whether or not that organization is going to make choices that respect the things you value.</p>\n<p>This same way of understanding systems can apply if you’re a designer or a product manager or a HR administrator or anything else. As I’ve covered before, <a href=\"https://anildash.com/2024/05/28/systems-the-purpose-of-a-system/\">the purpose of a system is what it does</a>, and that truth can provide some hard lessons if we find it’s in tension with the things we <em>want</em> to be doing for an organization. The system may not value the things we do, or it may not value them enough; the way they phrase this to avoid having to say it directly is by describing something as “inefficient”. Then, the question you have to ask yourself is, can you care about this kind of work or this kind of program at one level higher up in the system? Can it still be meaningful to you if it’s slightly more abstract? Because that may be the requirement for navigating the expectations that technology organizations will be foisting on everyone through the language of talking about “adopting AI”.</p>\n<h3>Understanding power</h3>\n<p>Just as important as understanding systems is understanding <em>power</em>. In the workplace, power is something real. It means being able to control how money is spent. It means being able to make decisions. It means being able to hire people, or fire them. Power is being able to say no.</p>\n<p>You probably don’t have enough power; that’s why you have worries. But you almost certainly have more power than you think, it’s just not as obvious how to wield it. The most essential thing to understand is that you will need to collaborate with your peers to exercise collective power for many of the most significant things you may wish to achieve.</p>\n<p>But even at an individual level, a key way of understanding power in your workplace is to consider the systems that you are part of, and then to reckon with which ones you can meaningfully change from your current position. Very often, people will, in a moment of frustration, say “this place couldn’t run without me!” And companies will almost always go out of their way to prove someone wrong if they hear that message.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you identify a system for operating the organization that no one else has envisioned, you’ve already <em>demonstrated</em> that this part of the organization couldn’t run without you, and you don’t need to say it or prove it. There is power in the mere action of creating that system. But a lot depends on where you have both the positional authority and the social permission to actually accomplish that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re dissatisfied with where you are, but have not decided to leave your current organization, then your first orders of business in this new year should be to consolidate power through building alliances with peers, and by understanding which fundamental systems of your organization you can define or influence, and thus be in control of. Once you’ve got power, you’ve got options.</p>\n<h3>Most tech isn’t “tech”</h3>\n<p>So far, we’re talking about very abstract stuff. What do we do if your job sucks right now, or if you don’t have a job today and you really need one? After vague things like systems and power, then what?</p>\n<p>Well, an important thing to understand, if you care about innovation and technology, is that the vast majority of technology doesn’t happen in the startup world, or even in the “tech industry”. Startups are only a tiny fraction of the entire realm of companies that create or use technology, and the giant tech companies are only a small percentage of all jobs or hiring within the tech realm.</p>\n<p>So much opportunity, inspiration, creativity, and possibility lies in applying the skills and experience that you may have from technological disciplines in other realms and industries that are often far less advanced in their deployment of technologies. In a lot of cases, these other businesses get taken advantage of for their lack of experience — and in the non-profit world, the lack of tech expertise or fluency is often exploited by both the technology vendors and bad actors who swoop in to capitalize on their vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Many of the people I talk to who bring their technology experience to other fields also tell me that the culture in more traditional industries is often less toxic or broken than things in Silicon Valley (or Silicon Valley-based) companies are these days, since older or more established companies have had time to work out the more extreme aspects of their culture. It’s an extraordinary moment in history when people who work on Wall Street tell me that even <em>their</em> HR departments wouldn’t put up with the kind of bad behavior that we’re seeing within the ranks of tech company execs.</p>\n<h3>Plan for the long term</h3>\n<p>This too shall pass. One of the great gifts of working in technology is that it’s given so many of us the habit of constantly learning, of always being curious and paying attention to the new things worth discovering. That healthy and open-minded spirit is an important part of how to navigate a moment when lots of people are being laid off, or lots of energy and attention are being focused on products and initiatives that don’t have a lot of substance behind them.\nEventually, people will want to return to what’s real. The companies that focus on delivering products with meaning, and taking care of employees over time, will be the ones that are able to persist past the current moment. So building habits that enable resiliency at both a personal and professional level is going to be key.</p>\n<p>As I’ve been fond of saying for a long time: don’t let your job get in the way of your career.</p>\n<p>Build habits and routines that serve your own professional goals. As much as you can, participate in the things that get your name out into your professional community, whether that’s in-person events in your town, or writing on a regular basis about your area of expertise, or mentoring with those who are new to your field. You’ll never regret building relationships with people, or being generous with your knowledge in ways that remind others that you’re great at what you do.</p>\n<p>If your time and budget permit, attend events in person or online where you can learn from others or respond to the ideas that others are sharing. The more people can see and remember that you’re engaged with the conversations about your discipline, the greater the likelihood that they’ll reach out when the next opportunity arises.</p>\n<p>Similarly, take every chance you can to be generous to others when you see a door open that might be valuable for them. I can promise you, people will <em>never</em> forget that you thought of them in their time of need, even if they don’t end up getting that role or nabbing that interview.</p>\n<h2>It’s an evolution, not a resolution</h2>\n<p>New years are often a time when people make a promise to themselves about how they’re going to change everything. If I can just get this new notebook to write in, I’m suddenly going to become a person who keeps a journal, and that will make me a person who’s on top of everything all the time.</p>\n<p>But hopefully you can see, many of the challenges that so many people are facing are systemic, and aren’t the result of any personal failings or shortcomings. So there isn’t some heroic individual change that you can make when you flip over to a new calendar month that will suddenly fix all the things.</p>\n<p>What you can control, though, are small iterative things that make you feel better on a human scale, in little ways, when you can. You can help yourself maintain perspective, and you can do the same for those around you who share your values, and who care about the same personal or professional goals that you do.</p>\n<p>A lot of us still care about things like the potential for technology to help people, or still believe in the idealistic and positive goals that got us into our careers in the first place. We weren’t wrong, or naive, or foolish to aspire to those goals simply because some bad actors sought to undermine them. And it’s okay to feel frustrated or scared in a time when it seems to many like those goals could be further away than they’ve been in a long time.</p>\n<p>I do hope, though, that people can see that, by sticking together, and focusing on the things that are within our reach, things can begin to change. All it takes is remembering that the power in tech truly rests with all the people who actually <em>make</em> things, not with the loudmouths at the top who try to tear things down.</p>",

    "link": "https://anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/",
    "summary": "<p>One of the key points I repeated when <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/\">talking about the state of the tech industry yesterday</a> was the salient fact that <em>half a million tech workers have been laid off since ChatGPT was released in late 2022</em>. Now, to be clear, those workers haven’t been laid off because their jobs are now being done by AI, and they’ve been replaced by bots. Instead, they’ve been laid off by execs who now have AI to use as an excuse for going after workers they’ve wanted to cut all along.</p>\n<p>This is important to understand for a few reasons. First, it’s key just for having empathy for both the mindset and the working conditions of people in the tech industry. For so many outside of tech, their impression of what “tech” means is whatever is the most recent transgression they’ve heard about from the most obnoxious billionaire who’s made the news lately. But in many cases, it’s the rank and file workers at that person’s company who were the first victims of that billionaire’s ego.</p>\n<p>Second, it’s important to understand the big tech companies as almost the testing grounds for the techniques and strategies that these guys want to roll out on the rest of the economy, and on the rest of the world. Before they started going on podcasts pretending to be extremely masculine while whining about their feelings, or overtly bribing politicians to give them government contracts, they beta-tested these manipulative strategies within their companies by cracking down on dissent and letting their most self-indulgent and egomaniacal tendencies run wild. Then, when people (reasonably!) began to object, they used that as an excuse to purge any dissenters for being uncooperative or “difficult”.</p>\n<h2>It starts with tech, but doesn’t end there</h2>\n<p>These are tactics they’ll be bringing to other industries and sectors of the economy, if they haven’t already. Sometimes they’ll be providing AI technologies and tools as an enabler or justification for the cultural and political agenda that they’re enacting, but often times, they don’t even need to. In many cases, they can simply make clear that they want to enforce psychological and social conformity within their organizations, and that any disagreement will not be tolerated, and the implicit threat of being replaced by automation (or by other workers who are willing to fall in line) is enough to get people to comply.</p>\n<p>This is the subtext, and sometimes the explicit text, of the deployment of “AI” in a lot of organizations. That’s separate from what actual AI software or technology can do. And it explains a lot of why the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/\">majority AI view</a> within the tech industry is nothing like the hype cycle that’s being pushed by the loudest voices of the big-name CEOs.</p>\n<p>Because people who work in tech still believe in the power of tech to do good things, many of us won’t just dismiss outright the possibility that any technology — even AI tools like LLMs — could yield some benefits. But the optimistic takes are tempered by the first-hand knowledge of how the tools are being used as an excuse to sideline or victimize good people.</p>\n<p>This wave of layoffs and reductions has been described as “pursuing efficiencies” or “right-sizing”. But so many of us in tech can remember a few years back, when working in tech as an upwardly-mobile worker with a successful career felt like the best job in the world. When many people could buy nice presents for their kids at Christmas or they weren’t as worried about your car payments. When huge parts of society were promising young people that there was a great future ahead if they would just learn to code. When the promise of a tech career’s potential was used as the foundation for building infrastructure in our schools and cities to train a whole new generation of coders.</p>\n<p>But the funders and tycoons in charge of the big tech companies <em>knew</em> that they did not want to keep paying enormous salaries to the people they were hiring. They certainly knew they didn’t want to keep paying huge hiring bonuses to young people just out of college, or to pay large staffs of recruiters to go find underrepresented candidates. Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to <em>them</em>. So yes, part of the reason for the huge investment in AI coding tools was to make it easier to write code. But another huge reason that AI got so good at writing code was so that nobody would ever have to pay coders so well again.</p>\n<p>You’re not wrong if you feel angry, resentful and overwhelmed by all of this; indeed, it would be absurd if you <em>didn’t</em> feel this way, since the wealthiest and most powerful people in the history of the world have been spending a few years trying to make you feel exactly this way. Constant rotating layoffs and a nonstop fear of further cuts, with a perpetual sense of precarity, are a deliberate strategy so that everyone will accept lower salaries and reduced benefits, and be too afraid to push for the exact same salaries that the company could afford to pay the year before.</p>\n<h2>Why are we stirring the pot?</h2>\n<p>Okay, so are we just trying to get each other all depressed? No. It’s just vitally important that we name a problem and identify it if we’re going to solve it.\n Most people outside of the technology industry think that “tech” is a monolith, that the people who work in tech are the same as the people who <em>own</em> the technology companies. They don’t know that tech workers are in the same boat that they are, being buffeted by the economy, and being subject to the whims of their bosses, or being displaced by AI. They don’t know that the DEI backlash has gutted HR teams at tech companies, too, for example. So it’s key for everyone to understand that they’re starting from the same place.</p>\n<p>Next, it’s key to tease apart things that are separate concerns. For example: AI is often an <em>excuse</em> for layoffs, not the cause of them. ChatGPT didn’t replace the tasks that recruiters were doing in attracting underrepresented candidates at big tech companies — the bosses just don’t care about trying to hire underrepresented candidates anymore! The tech story is being used to mask the political and social goal. And it’s important to understand that, because otherwise people waste their time fighting battles that might not matter, like the deployment of a technology system, and losing the ones that do, like the actual decisions that an organization is making about its future.</p>\n<h2>Are they efficient, though?</h2>\n<p>But what if, some people will ask, these companies just had <em>too many people</em>? What if they’d over-hired? The folks who want to feel really savvy will say, “I heard that they had all those employees because interest rates were low. It was a Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.” This is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. It’s not in any company’s best interests to cut their staffing down to the bone.</p>\n<p>You actually <em>need</em> to have some reserve capacity for labor in order to reach maximum output for a large organization. This is the difference between a large-scale organization and a small one. People sitting around doing nothing is the epitome of waste or inefficiency in a small team, but in a large organization, it’s a lot more costly if you are about to start a new process or project and you don’t have labor capacity or expertise to deploy.</p>\n<p>A good analogy is the oft-cited need these days for people to be bored more often. There’s a frequent lament that, because people are so distracted by things like social media and constant interruptions, they never have time to get bored and let their mind wander, and think new thoughts or discover their own creativity. Put another way, they never get the chance to tap into their own cognitive surplus.</p>\n<p>The only advantage a large organization can have over a small one, other than sheer efficiencies of scale, is if it has a cognitive surplus that it can tap into. By destroying that cognitive surplus, and leaving those who remain behind in a state of constant emotional turmoil and duress, these organizations are permanently damaging both their competitive advantages and their potential future innovations.</p>\n<h2>AI Spring</h2>\n<p>When the dust clears, and people realize that extreme greed is never the path to maximum long-term reward, there is going to be a “peace dividend” of sorts from all the good talent that’s now on the market. Some of this will be smart, thoughtful people flowing to other industries or companies, bringing their experience and insights with them.</p>\n<p>But I think a lot of this will be people starting their own new companies and organizations, informed by the broken economic models, and broken <em>human</em> models, of the companies they’ve left. We saw this a generation ago after the bust of the dot-com boom, when it was not only revealed that the economics of a lot of the companies didn’t work, but that so many of the people who had created the companies of that era didn’t even care about the markets or the industries that they’d entered. When the get-rich-quick folks left the scene, those of us who remained, who truly loved the web as a creative and expressive medium, found a ton of opportunity in being the little mammals amidst the sad dinosaurs trying to find funding for meteor dot com.</p>\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\n<p>I don’t think this all gets better very quickly. If you put aside the puffery of the AI companies scratching each others’ backs, it’s clear the economy is in a recession, even if this administration’s goons have shut down reporting on jobs and inflation in a vain attempt to hide that reality. But I do think there may be more resilience because of the sheer talent and entrepreneurial skill of the people who are now on the market as individuals.</p>",
