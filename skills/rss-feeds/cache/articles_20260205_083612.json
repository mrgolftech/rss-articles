There's no reason not to continue to serve archived versions - a banner at the top of the page saying it's no longer maintained would be much better than removing all of that valuable content entirely.</p>\n<p>Up until 2020 the CIA published annual zip file archives of the entire site. Those are available (along with the rest of the Factbook) <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260203124934/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/\">on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>I downloaded the 384MB <code>.zip</code> file for the year 2020 and extracted it into a new GitHub repository, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020/\">simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020</a>.

This is the latest in their Whisper-like model family, and a sequel to the original Voxtral which they released <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/16/voxtral/\">in July 2025</a>.</p>\n<p>Voxtral Realtime - official name <code>Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602</code> - is the open weights (Apache-2.0) model, available as a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602\">8.87GB download from Hugging Face</a>.</p>\n<p>You can try it out in this <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-Realtime\">live demo</a> - don't be put off by the \"No microphone found\" message, clicking \"Record\" should have your browser request permission and then start the demo working. I was very impressed by the demo - I talked quickly and used jargon like Django and WebAssembly and it correctly transcribed my text within moments of me uttering each sound. </p>\n<p>The closed weight model is called <code>voxtral-mini-latest</code> and can be accessed via the Mistral API, using calls that look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl -X POST <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>https://api.mistral.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -H <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Authorization: Bearer <span class=\"pl-smi\">$MISTRAL_API_KEY</span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F model=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>voxtral-mini-latest<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F file=@<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Pelican talk at the library.m4a<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F diarize=true \\\n  -F context_bias=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Datasette<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F timestamp_granularities=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>segment<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n\n<p>The Mistral API console now has a <a href=\"https://console.mistral.ai/build/audio/speech-to-text\">speech-to-text playground</a> for exercising the new model and it is <em>excellent</em>.

When ChatGPT launched, it was trading at 14; it&#8217;s gone up by more than a factor of ten since then, rising, until recently like a rocket. </p><p>Aside from Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang, a brilliant and impressive CEO with considerable foresight, nobody was more responsible for Nvidia&#8217;s rise than Sam Altman, the relentless showman who runs OpenAI &#8212; and who repeatedly promised the moon. </p><p>My favorite representative quote from Altman, just over a year ago, came in January 2025, back when too many people had too much faith him, writing in his blog &#8220;we are now confident we know how to build AGI.&#8221; It turns out this was authoritative bullshit. It sounded true and was said with confidence, but it was purely a bluff. Altman didn&#8217;t actually know how to build AGI [artificial general intelligence] then, and probably still doesn&#8217;t. Nvidia&#8217;s rise was predicated on the wrong-headed idea (long critiqued in this newsletter) that scaling would bring us to AGI. </p><p>As long as the scaling = AGI myth persisted, Nvidia, which makes the GPUs that fuel scaling, continued to rise like a rocket.</p><p>But all that changed on August 7th. That was the day that Altman introduced his wildly overhyped (for years) GPT-5 to the world, alleging, falsely, that it could do anything a PhD could do. By the end of the night, there was a rebellion in LLM land; people tried out the long awaited, much delayed model immediately, and just as quickly realized that what Altman said wasn&#8217;t true.</p><p>Questions that only a few of us (like Ed Zitron and myself) had been raising were suddenly on everyone&#8217;s lips. The industry seemed to increasingly rely on circular financing, so much so that an alternative <a href=\"https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFV-ustfSw56Q/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZl2Bl7xIwAs-/0/1758621755066?e%3D2147483647%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DMlsuC_iwl3q1QZGbW2RxLu95TC-b9c0hFkkmlqoJTRk&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopherobrien_episode-8-season-1-of-hbos-silicon-valley-activity-7376194264587976704-aboB&amp;h=756&amp;w=800&amp;tbnid=KgOiD1AxwRwYIM&amp;tbnh=218&amp;tbnw=231&amp;osm=1&amp;hcb=1&amp;source=lens-native&amp;docid=5WAyz49VXBUF7M\">NSFW framing of circular financing became a  meme</a>. </p><p>That circularity is a warning sign, reflecting a market that is propped up rather than functioning well on its own accord. Wall Street lost confidence, particularly after the crazy Oracle deal in September that I called at the time &#8220;peak bubble&#8221;.</p><p>On August 7, 2025, Nvidia was trading at about 181; today it stands at 177, stalled, a remarkable six month plateau for a stock that had risen more than 10x from 14 after ChatGPT was released in November 2022.  Not an all out crash, but an unmistakable sign that its ascent has run out of gas. GPU-wrangler Coreweave stood then at about 129 and now stands at about 89. Oracle was at 250 and now (after its short lived OpenAI bump in September) stands at 150.</p><p>That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August &#8212; this Saturday will be the half anniversary &#8212; was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic. LLMs are great, but they aren&#8217;t AGI, and they aren&#8217;t reliable. Moreover, they are expensive to operate, and because many companies can build roughly the same thing, they are commodities.</p><p>No moat = price wars. </p><p>No AGI = modest, not immense, profits. </p><p>As the investment press has been saying of late, investors have been &#8220;rotating out of tech stocks<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>&#8221; &#8211; because they realize they were sold a bill of goods.  My guess is that these stocks &#8211; and the reputation of OpenAI &#8211; will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for. </p><p>Not, at least, until newer, better, more robust approaches to AI are developed. For a few years, it seemed like the markets were swayed by hype, alternatives shut out. All that is starting to change. At last the market may be both ready&#8212;and desperate&#8212;for real AI. </p><p>The best news here is that with LLM mania subsiding, there might actually be a chance for newcomers to try new things.</p><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>People are likely rotating out of tech stocks for two almost contradictory reasons: some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they&#8217;re worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software. I am not sure that latter worry is realistic.</p><p></p></div></div>'}",

Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, <em>The Hospital at the End of the World</em>:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866\">https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866</a></p>\\n<p>I\\'ve followed Key\\'s work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers\\' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me &#8211; a standout writer in a year full of standouts &#8211; and I wasn\\'t surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, <em>The World Wasn\\'t Ready For You</em>, in 2023:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015</a></p>\\n<p>This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don\\'t publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven\\'t already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they\\'re names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll</a></p>\\n<p>But anyone who read <em>World Wasn\\'t Ready</em> immediately understood why Key\\'s work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops.</p>\\n<p><em>Hospital at the End of the World</em> is Key\\'s first novel, and it\\'s terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, <em>Hospital</em> follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok\\'s father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings.</p>\\n<p>The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from <em>every</em> medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That\\'s when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father.</p>\\n<p>To make things worse, Pok\\'s father has fallen grievously ill &#8211; so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn\\'t accompany his father, though &#8211; he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok\\'s apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization.</p>\\n<p>Thus begins Pok\\'s tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America\\'s AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok\\'s father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization\\'s rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine.</p>\\n<p>Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people.</p>\\n<p>This is the book\\'s second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth.</p>\\n<p>What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key\\'s own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It\\'s one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care. It\\'s a well-structured, well-paced sf novel that probes big, urgent contemporary themes while still engrossing the reader in the intimate human relations of its principals. A wonderful debut novel from a major new writer.`</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ken MacLeod: Imagined Futures <a href=\"https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/\">https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Elbows Up: How Canada Can Disenshittify Its Tech, Reclaim Its Sovereignty, and Launch a New Tech Sector Into a Stable Orbit <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation\">https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>HOPE IS NOW A 501(C)(3) NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION <a href=\"https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization\">https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Department of Justice appeals Google search monopoly ruling <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal\">https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>List of Kennedy Center cancellations during the Trump administration <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration</a> (h/t Amanda Marcotte)</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"retro\"></a><br />\\n<img alt=\"A shelf of leatherbound history books with a gilt-stamped series title, \\'The World\\'s Famous Events.\\'\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/worlds-famous-events.png?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<h1>Object permanence (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#retro\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p>#20yrsago AOL/Yahoo: our email tax will make the net as good as the post office! <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html</a></p>\\n<p>#20yrsago Volunteers ferry 15k coconuts every day to Indian temple <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Wikileaks ACTA cables confirm it was a screwjob for the global poor <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/\">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Laura Poitras’s Astro Noise: indispensable book and gallery show about mass surveillance <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/\">https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago How to prepare to join the Internet of the dead <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead\">https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Who funds the “Millennials Rising” Super PAC?

    "summary": "<p>I've been exploring Go for building small, fast and self-contained binary applications recently. I'm enjoying how there's generally one obvious way to do things and the resulting code is boring and readable - and something that LLMs are very competent at writing. The one catch is distribution, but it turns out publishing Go binaries to PyPI means any Go binary can be just a <code>uvx package-name</code> call away.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</a> is my new Go CLI tool for scanning a filesystem for SQLite database files.</p>\n<p>It works by checking if the first 16 bytes of the file exactly match the SQLite magic number sequence <code>SQLite format 3\\x00</code>. It can search one or more folders recursively, spinning up concurrent goroutines to accelerate the scan. It streams out results as it finds them in plain text, JSON or newline-delimited JSON. It can optionally display the file sizes as well.</p>\n<p>To try it out you can download a release from the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner/releases\">GitHub releases</a> - and then <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445\">jump through macOS hoops</a> to execute an \"unsafe\" binary. Or you can clone the repo and compile it with Go. Or... you can run the binary like this:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default this will search your current directory for SQLite databases. You can pass one or more directories as arguments:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner ~ /tmp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add <code>--json</code> for JSON output, <code>--size</code> to include file sizes or <code>--jsonl</code> for newline-delimited JSON. Here's a demo:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner ~ --jsonl --size\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"running that command produces a sequence of JSON objects, each with a path and a size key\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sqlite-scanner-demo.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If you haven't been uv-pilled yet you can instead install <code>sqlite-scanner</code> using <code>pip install sqlite-scanner</code> and then run <code>sqlite-scanner</code>.</p>\n<p>To get a permanent copy with <code>uv</code> use <code>uv tool install sqlite-scanner</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-the-python-package-works\">How the Python package works</h4>\n<p>The reason this is worth doing is that <code>pip</code>, <code>uv</code> and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a> will work together to identify the correct compiled binary for your operating system and architecture.</p>\n<p>This is driven by file names. If you visit <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/#files\">the PyPI downloads for sqlite-scanner</a> you'll see the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-win_arm64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-win_amd64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-musllinux_1_2_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-musllinux_1_2_aarch64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I run <code>pip install sqlite-scanner</code> or <code>uvx sqlite-scanner</code> on my Apple Silicon Mac laptop Python's packaging magic ensures I get that <code>macosx_11_0_arm64.whl</code> variant.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.pythonhosted.org%2Fpackages%2F88%2Fb1%2F17a716635d2733fec53ba0a8267f85bd6b6cf882c6b29301bc711fba212c%2Fsqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl#sqlite_scanner/__init__.py\">what's in the wheel</a>, which is a zip file with a <code>.whl</code> extension.</p>\n<p>In addition to the <code>bin/sqlite-scanner</code> the most important file is <code>sqlite_scanner/__init__.py</code> which includes the following:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">get_binary_path</span>():\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">\"\"\"Return the path to the bundled binary.\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">join</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">dirname</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">__file__</span>), <span class=\"pl-s\">\"bin\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s\">\"sqlite-scanner\"</span>)\n \n    <span class=\"pl-c\"># Ensure binary is executable on Unix</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">platform</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">!=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">\"win32\"</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">stat</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>).<span class=\"pl-c1\">st_mode</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">not</span> (<span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXUSR</span>):\n            <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">chmod</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXUSR</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXGRP</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXOTH</span>)\n \n    <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>\n \n \n<span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">main</span>():\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">\"\"\"Execute the bundled binary.\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">get_binary_path</span>()\n \n    <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">platform</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">==</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">\"win32\"</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-c\"># On Windows, use subprocess to properly handle signals</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">exit</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">subprocess</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">call</span>([<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>] <span class=\"pl-c1\">+</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">argv</span>[<span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>:]))\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">else</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-c\"># On Unix, exec replaces the process</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">execvp</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>, [<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>] <span class=\"pl-c1\">+</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">argv</span>[<span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>:])</pre>\n<p>That <code>main()</code> method -

It means that any functionality which is available in a cross-platform Go binary can now be subsumed into a Python package. Python is really good at running subprocesses so this opens up a whole world of useful tricks that we can bake into our Python tools.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate this, I built <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan\">datasette-scan</a> - a new Datasette plugin which depends on <code>sqlite-scanner</code> and then uses that Go binary to scan a folder for SQLite databases and attach them to a Datasette instance.</p>\n<p>Here's how to use that (without even installing anything first, thanks <code>uv</code>) to explore any SQLite databases in your Downloads folder:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with datasette-scan datasette scan <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/Downloads</pre></div>\n<p>If you peek at the code you'll see it <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/pyproject.toml#L14\">depends on sqlite-scanner</a> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and calls it using <code>subprocess.run()</code> against <code>sqlite_scanner.get_binary_path()</code> in its own <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/datasette_scan/__init__.py#L38-L58\">scan_directories() function</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been exploring this pattern for other, non-Go binaries recently - here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/livestream-gif.py\">a recent script</a> that depends on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/static-ffmpeg/\">static-ffmpeg</a> to ensure that <code>ffmpeg</code> is available for the script to use.</p>\n<h4 id=\"building-python-wheels-from-go-packages-with-go-to-wheel\">Building Python wheels from Go packages with go-to-wheel</h4>\n<p>After trying this pattern myself a couple of times I realized it would be useful to have a tool to automate the process.</p>\n<p>I first <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/2d9ced56-b3e8-4651-83cc-860b9b419187\">brainstormed with Claude</a> to check that there was no existing tool to do this. It pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.maturin.rs/bindings.html#bin\">maturin bin</a> which helps distribute Rust projects using Python wheels, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Bing-su/pip-binary-factory\">pip-binary-factory</a> which bundles all sorts of other projects, but did not identify anything that addressed the exact problem I was looking to solve.</p>\n<p>So I <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?41f04e4eb823b1ceb888d9a28c2280dd/index.html\">had Claude Code for web build the first version</a>, then refined the code locally on my laptop with the help of more Claude Code and a little bit of OpenAI Codex too, just to mix things up.</p>\n<p>The full documentation is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">simonw/go-to-wheel</a> repository. I've published that tool to PyPI so now you can run it using:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel --help</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>sqlite-scanner</code> package you can <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/\">see on PyPI</a> was built using <code>go-to-wheel</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/dev/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --set-version-var main.version \\\n  --version 0.1.1 \\\n  --readme README.md \\\n  --author <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Simon Willison<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  --url https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --description <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Scan directories for SQLite databases<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This created a set of wheels in the <code>dist/</code> folder. I tested one of them like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with dist/sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl \\\n  sqlite-scanner --version</pre></div>\n<p>When that spat out the correct version number I was confident everything had worked as planned, so I pushed the whole set of wheels to PyPI using <code>twine upload</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx twine upload dist/<span class=\"pl-k\">*</span></pre></div>\n<p>I had to paste in a PyPI API token I had saved previously and that was all it took.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-expect-to-use-this-pattern-a-lot\">I expect to use this pattern a lot</h4>\n<p><code>sqlite-scanner</code> is very clearly meant as a proof-of-concept for this wider pattern - Python is very much capable of recursively crawling a directory structure looking for files that start with a specific byte prefix on its own!</p>\n<p>That said, I think there's a <em>lot</em> to be said for this pattern. Go is a great complement to Python - it's fast, compiles to small self-contained binaries, has excellent concurrency support and a rich ecosystem of libraries.</p>\n<p>Go is similar to Python in that it has a strong standard library. Go is particularly good for HTTP tooling - I've built several HTTP proxies in the past using Go's excellent <code>net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy</code> handler.</p>\n<p>I've also been experimenting with <a href=\"https://github.com/wazero/wazero\">wazero</a>, Go's robust and mature zero dependency WebAssembly runtime as part of my ongoing quest for the ideal sandbox for running untrusted code. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/wasm-repl-cli\">Here's my latest experiment</a> with that library.</p>\n<p>Being able to seamlessly integrate Go binaries into Python projects without the end user having to think about Go at all - they <code>pip install</code> and everything Just Works - feels like a valuable addition to my toolbox.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/packaging\">packaging</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pypi\">pypi</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/sqlite\">sqlite</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv\">uv</a></p>",

Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id=\"fnref:gross-additions\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:gross-additions\">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>\n<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general \"themes\" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/\" target=\"_blank\">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href=\"https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this \"compatibility\" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>\n<p>Just like all the content was in <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/\" target=\"_blank\">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/\" target=\"_blank\">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/\" target=\"_blank\">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>\n<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's \"just\" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>\n<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Conference Season</h2>\n<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy! Here's where I'm speaking so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://qconlondon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QCon London</a>, March 16-19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://craft-conf.com/2026\" target=\"_blank\">Craft Conference</a>, Budapest, June 4-5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareshould.work/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Should Work</a>, Missouri, July 16-17</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hfpug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Functional Programmers</a>, Virtual, December 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the first three I'm giving variations of my talk \"How to find bugs in systems that don't exist\", which I gave last year at <a href=\"https://systemsdistributed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Systems Distributed</a>.

The Examiner is, frankly, more of the same - and I\\'m happy with that!</p>\\n\\n<p>You, the reader, are given a series of transcripts and have to work out what crime (if any) has been committed. You don\\'t find out who the victim(s) is/are until reasonably far through the story. The characters are well realised (although a little similar to some of her others). The twists are shockingly good and will make you flick back to see if you could have spotted them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Hallett is <em>exquisite</em> at building tension through the slow drip-drip-drip of reveals. OK, so the transcripts are a bit unrealistic but they make a good scaffold. While it might be nice to include user avatars on the WhatsApp messages, the characters\\' voices are unique enough to distinguish them easily.</p>\\n\\n<p>Much like <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/book-review-the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-by-janice-hallett/\">The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</a>, the book plays around with symbolism and the nature of faith. You may find yourself sympathising with the characters and then quickly recanting!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"technical-issues\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/book-review-the-examiner-janice-hallett/#technical-issues\">Technical Issues</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Viper, the publisher, seem to have messed up the structure of this eBook. Despite being published in 2024, they\\'re using an <em>ancient</em> and obsolete version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz/\">Blitz ePub CSS</a> which itself was archived back in 2020. As well as strange indents, there\\'s a hard-coded 2em margin only on the right.</p>\\n\\n<p>Accessibility is poor. All the abbreviations use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element. But some kind of automated find-and-replace has mangled most of them. For example, the \"Masters degree in Multimedia Art (Full-Time Programme)\" is shortened to \"MMAM(FTP)\" and then given the nonsensical abbreviation of \"Molecular Area Per Molecule (File Transfer Protocol)\"!</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/how-long-does-it-take-to-upgrade-an-ebook/\">Much like before</a> I\\'ve written to them asking them to correct it.</p>'}",

    "summary": "<p>After the acquisition by a much larger company, security became a top priority. Our company occupied three tall buildings, each at least 13 stories high. Key card readers were installed next to every entrance, every elevator car, and even at the parking lot entrance, which itself was eight stories tall.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The parking lot system was activated first. If you wanted to park your car, you needed to scan your pass. It didn't take long for lines to start forming, but they were still manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Then the doors were activated. I would often forget my key card on my desk and get stuck in the stairwell. After lunch, I'd climb the stairs all the way to the 11th floor, only to find myself locked out at the door. Fortunately, the buildings were full of people, and there was always someone to open the door for me. I'd slip in suspiciously while they contemplated the email that clearly said not to let anyone in with your own card.</p>\n\n<p>While we were battling to get used to the key cards, the company was installing turnstiles on the ground floor of every building. They looked futuristic, but I was already anticipating a problem the designers hadn't considered. Each building had 13 floors. Each floor was full of employees. Hundreds of employees per building would each have to scan their card to get in.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer. I understand that security isn't an optional feature you build on top of your application. Instead, you need to implement safeguards at the foundation. In fact, one of the most important applications I was working on was a tool to manage how different teams retrieved their tasks from Jira. If you've read this blog before, you know I always complain about Jira.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the original designer of this application must have been pressed for time. Each action in the app required a call to the Jira endpoint, which needed authentication. He never saved the auth token returned by the API. Instead, each call had to re-authenticate and then perform its task.</p>\n\n<p>Did he ask the user to reenter the password every single time? No, he was smarter than that. Did he save the credentials in the database in plain text? He might have <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/hiring-angular-experts-not\">been an intern</a>, but he wasn't crazy. No! Instead, he saved the username and password in the cookies. But for good measures, it was base64 encoded.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we received the email. All turnstiles were going to be activated. The following Monday, they would run in mock mode, where the turnstiles would remain open, but we'd have to scan and wait for the beep and green light before entering.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at 8:30am. I met my colleagues and hundreds of other employees in the lobby. When the first person scanned their card, the machine beeped and turned green. We all clapped in celebration. We took turns making our way to the machine. Beep, turn green, next. But it grumbled for some employees and turned red. That was fine though, it was mock day. We all went about our day.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, when I came to work, I remained in my car, stuck in line for the parking lot for at least 10 minutes. Looking outside, I saw long lines of people circling each building.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to park my car and discovered that the line of people extended all the way down to the parking level. I waited in line for at least 30 minutes just to make it to the lobby. I texted my manager that I'd be late for the daily standup because I was stuck in line. She didn't text back. Instead, she waved at me from the front of the line. Scanning was already slow, you had to wait to be approved. But once you passed the turnstile, there was another line for the elevators. The elevator key card readers were also active.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a couple dozen people all trying to squeeze into crowded elevators, each going to a different floor, and each trying to scan their key card to access their floor because someone who wasn't authorized for that floor couldn't scan it for them. Some elevator doors opened with a few people already inside because they couldn't scan their cards in the crowd, so they'd gone back down for a second attempt. In other words, it was complete chaos.</p>\n\n<p>It took more than an hour to go from the parking lot to my desk on the 11th floor.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I decided to save time and take an Uber to work. Those were the days when an <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/paying-for-my-8-years-old-ride\">Uber ride cost only $3</a>. I thought I was being smart, but another hundred people or so had the same idea. We had a pile of Uber rides lining up outside, each trying to drop off their riders and blocking the way to the parking lot, causing yet another traffic jam. Inside the building, it was still the same chaos. I only saved a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>On the third day, they shut down the turnstiles. They clearly weren't working. They also disabled the key card readers in the elevators. It was a relief.</p>\n\n<p>Security was supposedly a priority, yet nobody ever talked about the Jira credentials saved in cookies. I received significant pushback when I requested we install a Redis service to store the generated auth tokens. I had to write entire documents to justify using it and request enterprise support from a vendor. After a month, the security issue was fixed to no fanfare.</p>\n\n<p>We did, however, receive an email celebrating the installation of three new turnstiles in the lobby. They never turned the elevator key card readers back on. They remained dormant, a reminder of the mess we'd gone through.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The turnstiles were visible. They were expensive. They disrupted everyone's day and made headlines in company-wide emails. Management could point to them and say that we're taking security seriously. Meanwhile, thousands of employees had their Jira credentials stored in cookies. A vulnerability that could expose our entire project management system. But that fix required documentation, vendor approval, a month of convincing people it mattered. A whole lot of begging.</p>\n\n<p>Security theater checks a box. It makes people feel like something is being done. Real security is invisible. It's reviewing code, implementing proper authentication, storing tokens correctly. It doesn't come with a ribbon-cutting ceremony or a celebratory email. It's just good engineering that nobody notices when it's done right. But security theater is impossible to miss.</p>",

I posted a little about this on Facebook and LinkedIn, but thought I&apos;d expand on what really stuck with me after watching other speakers: the effort agencies are putting into cybercrime prevention. It&apos;s very easy for folks to judge law enforcement solely on what they see from the outside, and that&apos;s mostly going after offenders and taking down criminal infrastructure. But the bit I&apos;m increasingly seeing behind the scenes is a push to help kids (the sorts of hackers I usually interact with are teenagers or young adults at most) make better choices when they&apos;re faced with a pathway into cybercrime. The transition from minor offences (game cheats and DDoS&apos;ing) to full-on cybercriminals (hacking and extortion) is very well-known, and intervening at the right time can not only make a difference to the impact of data breaches on all of us, but it can also make a massive difference to these kids&apos; lives. These agencies are underfunded and understaffed compared to the scale of the problem, so making the time to come visit and find some ways to help in our little corner of the data breach world is a no-brainer &#x1f60a;</p>\\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\\n<div><div style=\"width: 170px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/troy-hunts-weekly-update-podcast/id1176454699?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Listen-on-Apple-Podcasts.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 175px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LAAxaabizMAXnJe0s3xjQ30q12EVmjt&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/09/Watch-and-Listen-on-YouTube.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 118px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7jMtKFohdrw6qmz8AkLqit?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/10/spotify.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 120px; display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/troy-hunt-weekly-update/playlists/podcast.rss?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/07/Download-via-RSS.svg\" /></a></div></div>\\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->'}",

SpaceX will be oh so much better with access to all your tweets and xAI&#8217;s models! That&#8217;s the narrative Elon&#8217;s selling. You can read it on the SpaceX website, which tells us that the merged everything company will be &#8220;the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world&#8217;s foremost real-time information and free speech platform&#8221;. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=a+floor+wax+that%27s+also+a+dessert+topping%21+gilda&amp;iar=videos&amp;t=ipad&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzOlhHakrKeE\">a floor wax that&#8217;s also a dessert topping!</a>  Hopefully back in the real world the good folks at SpaceX aren&#8217;t about to replace their carefully-developed symbolic navigation algorithms with an LLM trained on X. Kaboom.</p><p>Theory Two (&#8220;Musk is tightening his grip over the tech that shapes national security, social media, and Al&#8221;, per WIRED) is that Elon wants to run the world, and what&#8217;s better than a soup to nuts integration between owning your tweets and owning the satellites your data crosses? I don&#8217;t doubt for a minute  that Musk wants to tighten his grip on all of that, but I don&#8217;t immediately see how this move accomplishes that.</p><p>Theory Three (&#8220;Musk&#8217;s SpaceX-xAl deal is an ambitious bet that the future of Al compute is in space&#8221;, per the Information) also seems dodgy. I hear all the chatter about build data centers in space, but a joint venture between the satellite company and the people building infrastructure for XAI might suffice. If you even believe at all that data centers in space are really going to be a big, profitable thing in the next decade. (Count me skeptical, though the economics of such things is not my area of expertise.)</p><p>Me, I think the merger is really a kind of bailout, to give a lot of cash to a company that is otherwise in distress. Fact is, xAI ain&#8217;t doing all that great. It&#8217;s burning money fast, with no obvious business model or market niche, and has little to show for it. They have also faced a lot of backlash for being reckless and irresponsible; hardly a good brand name. Grok (their main product) doesn&#8217;t have the users that ChatGPT has, and it doesn&#8217;t have the prestige that Google&#8217;s Gemini seems to be racking up. It also doesn&#8217;t have the clear corporate focus that Anthropic has. Nor does it have any obvious secret sauce. These numbers below from The Information are jawdropping. Would you want to give up valuable SpaceX shares for an also-ran?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yrbJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bc1e4aa-90fe-4027-96c1-df982be5a259_2005x774.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yrbJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bc1e4aa-90fe-4027-96c1-df982be5a259_2005x774.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>For me anyway, the math ain&#8217;t mathing. Trading SpaceX at sixty times 2025 revenue seems, um, optimistic, but at least they have a near-monopoly on both low-cost rackets and satellite internet infrastructure. In contrast, trading xAI at a thousand times revenue when they are in an increasingly crowded field where everyone is being forced into price wars seems nuts. If I owned SpaceX shares I would feel like Elon way overpaid for his own company. For not that much more they could have bought Anthropic, which has had far broader adoption and far less controversy attached to it. </p><p>Anyone remember Tesla&#8217;s acquisition of Musk&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity\">SolarCity</a>, and how that turned out?</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Ps Update to my Sunday essay on OpenClaw.

    "summary": "<p>You’ve probably heard this famous quote from Steve Jobs about saying ‘no’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, we have AI now. We don’t have to say no to 1,000 things. We can say yes to all the things — generate them all, simultaneously!</p>\n<p>Do you really have to “pick carefully” when AI can materialize everything you previously would’ve been too constrained to do?</p>\n<p>Generative technology paired with being “data-driven” means it’s easy to build every idea, ship it, measure it, and see what sticks.</p>\n<p>Humans, money, time — these all used to be constraints which required budgets, trade-offs, and decision making.</p>\n<p>Organizations had an incentive to say “no” when development was constrained — “We can only do so much, so let’s make sure we do the most impactful things.”</p>\n<p>But maybe the scarcity of organizational resources was the wrong focus all along?</p>\n<p>It’s never been a good idea to ship everything you think of. Every addition accretes complexity and comes with a cognitive cost.</p>\n<p>Maybe we need to reframe the concept of scarcity from <em>us</em>, the makers of software, to <em>them</em>, the users of software. Their resources are what matter most:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention (too many features and they can’t all be used, or even tried)</li>\n<li>Stability (too much frequent change is an impediment to learning a product)</li>\n<li>Clarity (too many options creates confusion and paralysis)</li>\n<li>Coherence (too many plots and subplots cannot tell a unified story)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So maybe the way you argue for saying “no” isn’t because it helps <em>you</em> as a business, but because it helps your customers. It helps them make sense of what you’ve made.</p>\n<p>And yet: arguing for customer clarity has always been harder than arguing for internal efficiency or some bottom line.</p>\n<p>In an age of abundance, restraint becomes the only scarce thing left, which means saying “no” is more valuable than ever.</p>\n<p>I’m as proud of the things I haven’t generated as the things I have.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/saying-no/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",

He spent his whole career documenting the fact that &#8220;free&#8221; parking ultimately backfires, and it&#8217;s better to charge for parking instead and use the revenues to make neighborhoods nicer: plant trees, spruce up the parks, keep the sidewalks clean.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p><p>Shoup&#8217;s ideas have been adopted all over the world, with heartening results. When you price parking appropriately, traffic goes down, fewer people get tickets, and you know there&#8217;s going to be a space waiting for you when you arrive.</p><p>Many so-called &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; strive for such an impact and never come close. What made Shoup so effective? Three things, <a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">says his student M. Nolan Gray</a>:</p><ol><li><p>He picked an unsexy topic where low-hanging fruit was just waiting to be picked.</p></li><li><p>He made his ideas palatable to all sorts of politics, explaining to conservatives, libertarians, progressives, and socialists how pay-for-parking regimes fit into each of their ideologies.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p></li><li><p>He maintained strict message discipline. When asked about the Israel-Palestine protests on campus, he reportedly responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m just wondering where they all parked&#8221;.</p></li></ol><p>So the next time you find a convenient parking spot, thank Shoup, and the next time you want to apply your wits to improving the world, <em>be </em>Shoup.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3tsg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6724b2-a41f-4687-ad64-b45da204d99d_1024x768.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"437.25\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3tsg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6724b2-a41f-4687-ad64-b45da204d99d_1024x768.png\" width=\"583\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>2. BE A PUBLIC CHARACTER</strong></h1><p>Jane Jacobs, the great urban theorist, once wrote that the health of a neighborhood depends on its &#8220;public characters&#8221;.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> For instance, two public characters in Jacobs&#8217; neighborhood are Mr. and Mrs. Jaffe, who own a convenience store. On one winter morning, Jacobs observes the Jaffes provide the following services to the neighborhood, all free of charge:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>supervised the small children crossing at the corner on the way to [school]</p></li><li><p>lent an umbrella to one customer and a dollar to another</p></li><li><p>took custody of a watch to give the repair man across the street when he opened later</p></li><li><p>gave out information on the range of rents in the neighborhood to an apartment seeker</p></li><li><p>listened to a tale of domestic difficulty and offered reassurance</p></li><li><p>told some rowdies they could not come in unless they behaved and then defined (and got) good behavior</p></li><li><p>provided an incidental forum for half a dozen conversations among customers who dropped in for oddments</p></li><li><p>set aside certain newly arrived papers and magazines for regular customers who would depend on getting them</p></li><li><p>advised a mother who came for a birthday present not to get the ship-model kit because another child going to the same birthday party was giving that</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Some people think they can&#8217;t contribute to the world because they have no unique skills. How can you help if you don&#8217;t know kung fu or brain surgery? But as Jacobs writes, &#8220;A public character need have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function&#8212;although he often does. He just needs to be present [...] his main qualification is that he <em>is </em>public, that he talks to lots of different people.&#8221; Sometimes all we need is a warm body that is willing to be <em>extra </em>warm.</p><h1><strong>3. MAKE A SOCIAL NUCLEATION SITE</strong></h1><p>I once did a high school science fair experiment where I put Mentos in different carbonated beverages and measured the height of the resulting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_geyser\">geysers</a>. The scientific value of this project was, let&#8217;s say, <em>limited</em>, but I did learn something interesting: despite how it looks to the naked eye, bubbles don&#8217;t come from nowhere. They only form at <em>nucleation sites</em>&#8212;little pits and scratches where molecules can gather until they reach critical mass.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9-6P!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc95b0ce7-4cce-42a8-a6b8-45010506444d_5478x1562.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9-6P!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc95b0ce7-4cce-42a8-a6b8-45010506444d_5478x1562.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">the title page of my science fair report (photo cred: my dad)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The same thing is true of human relationships. People are constantly crashing against each other in the great sea of humanity, but only under special conditions do they form the molecular bonds of friendship. As far as I can tell, these social nucleation sites only appear in the presence of what I would call <em>unreasonable attentiveness</em>.</p><p>For instance, my freshman year hallmates were uncommonly close because our resident advisor was uncommonly intense. Most other groups shuffle halfheartedly through the orientation day scavenger hunt; Kevin instructed us to show up in gym shorts and running shoes, and barked at us back and forth across campus as we attempted to locate the engineering library and the art museum. When we narrowly missed first place, he hounded the deans until they let us share in the coveted grand prize, a trip to Six Flags.</p><p>We bonded after that, not just because we had all gotten our brains rattled at the same frequency on the Superman rollercoaster, but because we could all share a knowing look with each other like, &#8220;<em>This </em>guy, right?&#8221; Kevin&#8217;s unreasonable attentiveness made our hallway A Thing. He created a furrow in the fabric of social space-time where a gaggle of 18-year-olds could glom together.</p><p>Being in the presence of unreasonable attentiveness isn&#8217;t always pleasant, but then, nucleation sites are technically imperfections. Bubbles don&#8217;t form in a perfectly smooth glass, and human groups don&#8217;t form in perfectly smooth experiences. Unreasonable attentiveness creates the slight unevenness that helps people realize they need something to hold onto&#8212;namely, each other.</p><h1><strong>4. SELL ONIONS ON THE INTERNET</strong></h1><p>Peter Askew didn&#8217;t intend to become an onion merchant. He just happened to be a compulsive buyer of domain names, and when he noticed that <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> was up for sale, <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/\">he snagged it</a>. He then discovered that some people love Vidalia onions. Like, <em>really </em>love them:</p><blockquote><p>During a phone order one season &#8211; 2018 I believe &#8211; a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to &#8216;<em>take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad</em>.&#8217;</p></blockquote><p>But these allium aficionados didn&#8217;t have a good way to get in-season onions because Vidalias can only be grown in Georgia, and it&#8217;s a pain for small farms to maintain a direct-to-consumer shipping business on the side. Enter Askew, who now makes a living by pleasing the Vidalia-heads:</p><blockquote><p>Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: &#8220;THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>People have polarized views of business these days. Some people think <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/904320/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-thinks-grandparents-should-willing-sacrifice-lives-save-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">we should feed grandma to the economy so it can grow bigger</a>, while other people think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Mangione\">we should gun down CEOs in the street</a>. <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> is, I think, a nice middle ground: you find a thing people want, you give it to them, you pocket some profit. So if you want an honest day&#8217;s work, maybe figure out what else people want chopped up and put on their cruise ship salads.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0M93!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F968f518d-e56f-44fe-99cd-de00e21ebe6e_980x600.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0M93!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F968f518d-e56f-44fe-99cd-de00e21ebe6e_980x600.png\" width=\"980\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">I was going to make a joke about Vidalia onions being a subpar cruise food because they don&#8217;t prevent scurvy but it turns out <a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/nutrition/\">they actually contain a meaningful amount of vitamin C</a> so wow maybe these things really are as great as they say (<a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>5. BE AN HONEST BROKER IN AN OTHERWISE SKEEVY INDUSTRY</strong></h1><p>I know a handful of people who have needed immigration lawyers, and they all say the same thing: there are no good immigration lawyers.</p><p>I think this is because the most prosocially-minded lawyers become public defenders or work at nonprofits representing cash-strapped clients, while the most capable and amoral lawyers go to white-shoe firms where they can make beaucoup bucks representing celebrity murderers and Halliburton. This leaves a doughnut hole for people who aren&#8217;t indigent, but also aren&#8217;t Intel. So if you want to help people, but you also don&#8217;t want to make peanuts, you could do a lot of good by being an honest and competent immigration lawyer.</p><p>I think there are lots of jobs like that, roles that don&#8217;t get good people because they aren&#8217;t sacrificial enough to attract the do-gooders and they aren&#8217;t lucrative enough to attract the overachievers. Home repair, movers, daycares, nursing homes, local news, city government&#8212;these are places where honesty and talent can matter a lot, but supply is low.</p><p>So if your career offers you the choice of being a starving saint or a wealthy sinner, consider being a middle-class mensch instead. You may not be helping the absolute neediest people, and you may not be able to afford a yacht, but there are lots of folks out there who would <em>really </em>like some help getting their visas renewed, and they&#8217;d be very happy to meet you.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1><strong>6. IMPROVE A STATISTIC</strong></h1><p>I have this game I like to play called Viral Statistics Bingo, where you find statistics that have gone viral on the internet and you try to trace them back to their original source. You&#8217;ll usually find that they have one of five dubious origins:</p><ul><li><p>A crummy study done in like 1904</p></li><li><p>A study that was done on mice</p></li><li><p>A book that&#8217;s out of print and now no one can find it</p></li><li><p>A complete misinterpretation of the data</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s just something some guy said once</p></li></ul><p>That means anyone with sufficient motivation can render a public service by improving the precision of a famous number. For example, the sex worker/data scientist <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> realized that no one has any idea what percentage of sex workers are victims of human trafficking. By combining her own surveys with re-analysis of publicly available data, <a href=\"https://aella.substack.com/p/what-percentage-of-sex-workers-in\">she estimates that it&#8217;s 3.2%</a>. That number is probably not exactly right, but then, <em>no </em>statistic is exactly right&#8212;the point is that it puts us in the right ballpark, that you can check her work for yourself, and that it&#8217;s a lot better than basing our numbers on a study done in mice.</p><h1><strong>7. BE A HOBBIT</strong></h1><p>The US <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-clinical-trial-abundance?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web\">does a bad job regulating clinical trials</a>, and it means we don&#8217;t invent as many life-saving medicines as we could. <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> is trying to change that, and she says that scientists and doctors often give her damning information that would be very helpful for her reform efforts. But her sources refuse to go on the record because it might put their careers in a bit of jeopardy. Not <em>real</em> jeopardy, mind you, like if you drive your minivan into the dean&#8217;s office or if you pants the director of the NIH. We&#8217;re talking <em>mild</em> jeopardy, like you might be 5% less likely to win your next grant.</p><p>She refers to this as <a href=\"https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/for-clinical-trial-reform-we-need\">&#8220;hobbitian courage&#8221;</a>, as in, not the kind of courage required to meet an army of Orcs on the battlefield, but the courage required to take a piece of jewelry on a field trip to a volcano:</p><blockquote><p>The quieter, hobbitian form of courage that clinical development reform (or any other hard systems problem) requires is humble: a researcher agreeing to let you cite them, an administrator willing to deviate from an inherited checklist, a policymaker ready to question a default.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s understandable that most people don&#8217;t want to risk their lives or blow up their careers to save the world. But most situations don&#8217;t actually call for the ultimate sacrifice.

If you work at a university, you have to wait weeks for an Institutional Review Board to tell you whether it&#8217;s okay to ask people how much they like Pop-Tarts. The IRS knows how much you owe in taxes, but instead of telling you, you&#8217;re supposed to guess, and if you guess wrong, you owe them additional money&#8212;it&#8217;s like playing the world&#8217;s worst game show, and the host also has a monopoly on the legitimate means of violence.</p><p>If you can de-gum the gears of one of these systems&#8212;even a sub-sub-sub-system!&#8212;you could improve the lives of millions of people. To pick a totally random example, if you work for the Department of Finance for the City of Chicago, and somebody is like &#8220;Hey, this very nice blogger just moved to town and he didn&#8217;t know that you have to get a sticker from us in order to have a vehicle inside city limits, let&#8217;s charge him a $200 fine!&#8221;, you could say in reply, &#8220;What if we <em>didn&#8217;t </em>do that? What if we <em>asked</em> him to get the sticker instead, and only fined him if he didn&#8217;t follow through? Because seriously, how are people supposed to know about this sticker system? When you move to Chicago, does the ghostly form of JB Pritzker appear to you in a dream and explain that you need both a sticker from the state of Illinois, which goes on the license plate, <em>and </em>a sticker from the city of Chicago, which goes on your windshield? Do we <em>serve </em>the people, or do we <em>terrorize </em>them?&#8221; Just as one example.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D26R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a994c50-bbfe-45ed-be68-98d57672a2cf_823x1098.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"697.7569866342649\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D26R!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a994c50-bbfe-45ed-be68-98d57672a2cf_823x1098.png\" width=\"523\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">&#8220;oOoOoOo don&#8217;t forget to move your car during street cleaning on the third Thursday of every month!!!&#8221; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JB_Pritzker#/media/File:J.B._Pritzker_April_2023_(3x4).jpg\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>9. BE GOOD AUDIENCE</strong></h1><p>I used to perform at a weekly standup gig when I lived in the UK, and this guy Wally would always be there in the second row. I got the impression that he didn&#8217;t have anywhere else to be, but we didn&#8217;t mind, because Wally was Good Audience.</p><p>When the jokes were good, he laughed loud and hard, and when the jokes were bad, he politely waited for more good jokes. Wally brought his friends, they brought their friends, and having more Good Audience made the acts better, too. (When comedians only perform for each other, no one laughs.) Eventually the gig got big, so big that it would sell out every week, and we&#8217;d have to set aside a ticket for Wally or else he wouldn&#8217;t get in. Ten years later, that show is still running.</p><p>Fran Leibowitz once <a href=\"https://x.com/jatella/status/1958171790489862635\">said</a> that the AIDS epidemic wiped out not just a generation of artists, but also a generation of <em>audience</em>. Great writers, performers, filmmakers, etc. cannot exist without great readers, watchers, and commentators&#8212;and not just because they open their wallets and put butts in seats, but because they pluck the diamonds out of the rough, they show it to their friends and pass it on to their kids, they raise it above their heads while wading through the sea of slop, shouting, &#8220;This! Look at <em>this</em>!&#8221;</p><h1><strong>10. ACQUAINT YOURSELF</strong></h1><p>Years ago, my friend Drew was visiting me when we noticed a whiff of natural gas in the hallway outside my apartment. I thought it was nothing&#8212;my building wasn&#8217;t the nicest, and it often smelled of many things&#8212;but Drew, who is twice as affable and Midwestern as I am, insisted we call the gas company. A bored technician arrived and halfheartedly waved his gas-detecting wand around my neighbor&#8217;s door, at which point his eyes got wide. He rushed to the basement, where he saw the gas meter spinning wildly, meaning that gas was pouring into my neighbor&#8217;s apartment.</p><p>&#8220;We gotta get this door open,&#8221; he said.</p><p>No one answered when we pounded on the door, so we summoned the fire department, who busted open a window and found my neighbor unconscious on the floor. His stove&#8217;s burners was on, but not lit, turning his apartment into a gas chamber. They told us the guy probably would have died if someone didn&#8217;t call, and the building might have caught on fire.</p><p>I was glad the guy survived, but I was ashamed that he had to be saved by a total stranger, while his own neighbor was ready to walk on by. I should have known him! I should have brought him Christmas cookies! We should have played checkers in the park on Saturdays! In the days afterward, I fantasized about knocking on his door or leaving him a note, like, &#8220;Hey! I notice you are elderly and alone, and I am young and nearby, maybe we should get a <em>Tuesdays with Morrie </em>thing going?&#8221;</p><p>But I never did that. I was too intimidated. Besides, am I supposed to become bosom buddies with every schmuck who lives in my building? Who&#8217;s got time for that?</p><p>Now that I&#8217;ve lived among many schmucks in many different buildings, I realized that I didn&#8217;t need to be this guy&#8217;s best friend. I just needed to be his acquaintance. If I knew his name, if I had even spoken to him once in the hallway, then when I got a noseful of gas outside his door, I would have thought to myself, &#8220;Oh, Rob&#8217;s apartment shouldn&#8217;t smell like that.&#8221; Rob &#8216;n&#8217; me were never going to be Mitch and Morrie, but we could have easily been Guys Who Kind of Recognize Each Other and Would Be Willing to Report the Presence of Dangerous Chemicals on Each Other&#8217;s Behalf.</p><h1><strong>DEATH STAR SUPERSTARS</strong></h1><p>A lot of well-intentioned people suffer from what we might call <em>Superhero Syndrome</em>: they want to save the world, but they want it to be saved by them in particular. They want to be the one who blows up the Death Star, not the one who washes the X-Wings.</p><p>This is a seductive fantasy because it disguises selfishness as sacrifice. It promises to excuse a lifetime of mediocrity with one great gesture, to pay off all your karmic debts in one fell swoop. The result is a world full of heroes-in-waiting who comfort themselves by thinking they <em>would </em>jump on a grenade if the situation ever presented itself, which fortunately it never does.</p><p>We do occasionally need someone to shoot torpedos into the exhaust port of a giant doomsday machine. But most of the time, we need people who sell onions, people who make sure the kids get to school safely, people who will show up to the comedy gig and laugh. I&#8217;d like to live in a world full of people like that, I&#8217;d be happy to pay for the sticker that lets me park there.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><em>Experimental History </em>would tell you about a gas leak right away, promise</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" tabindex=\"-1\" type=\"email\" /><input class=\"button primary\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" /><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Free parking sounds nice, so why isn&#8217;t it a good idea?

    "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260203-00/?p=112035",
    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/feed', 'value': '<p>Back in the day, if you wandered into the parking area behind Building 11 on the original Redmond Microsoft campus, you would find a very large satellite dish antenna. This antenna was used for receiving video signals, such as cable television feeds for distribution to the Redmond campus. One purpose was to provide cable TV service for internal development and testing to teams like the Windows Media Center team and later the Xbox One team.</p>\\n<p>The satellite dish antenna was a Simulsat-5 which was capable of gathering signals from 35 satellites simultaneously. (The record during this particular antenna&#8217;s lifetime was 26 simultaneous satellites.) It was a stationary antenna, not capable of changing its orientation. It went into service in 1997, was upgraded a few times, until it was finally decommissioned in 2017 when all of its tasks had been subsumed by a satellite dish antenna at the Studio C building.</p>\\n<p>Fun trivial about the satellite dish antenna:</p>\\n<p>In the summer, bees would nest in the feedbox (the thingie at focus of the satellite dish antenna that collected the signal), so you had to be careful when doing work there to avoid getting stung.</p>\\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t fun in the winter either, because the enclosure for the electronic equipment (known as the &#8220;doghouse&#8221;) would get filled with spiders who enjoyed the warmth from the equipment.</p>\\n<p>Snow had to be kept off the antenna for it to continue receiving signals, so whether or not Microsoft formally declared a snow closure, somebody had to remain on site to clear off the snow.</p>\\n<p>In 2007, there was a mystery to be solved: Occasionally, there would be interference that disrupted the signal. After some investigation, it was discovered that the source was electromagnetic interference generated by the pressure washers that were used to clean the parking lot. The water connection port was at the rear of Building 11, right near the satellite dish antenna. The solution was to do parking lot cleaning at night (when there was less demand for video signals), or if doing it during the day, to put the water pressure generators far away from the antenna.</p>\\n<p>My favorite piece of trivia is that in addition to being able to control the satellite dish antenna via the front panel, you could also control it over an RS-232 serial port. The serial line ran from the satellite dish to a Toshiba model 400CDT Satellite Pro (get it? <span>Satellite</span> pro?) running MS-DOS.

To prove it, you need only pick up <em>The Universe Box</em>, Swanwick\\'s just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field\\'s greatest writers at the absolute <em>pinnacle</em> of his game:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/\">https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/</a></p>\\n<p>Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is  a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, <em>multiple</em> sf magazines that publish short stories <em>every month</em>, on <em>paper</em>, and <em>pay for it</em>. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s a pretty common trajectory in sf, where &#8211; notwithstanding the field\\'s status as a haven for the short story &#8211; the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can\\'t assume anything about the story\\'s setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies.</p>\\n<p>All of that has to be established <em>in the story</em>. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There\\'s a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don\\'t tell\"). It\\'s fairer to say that exposition is <em>hard</em> &#8211; dramatization is, well, <em>dramatic</em>, which makes it easier to engage the reader\\'s attention. But great exposition is <em>great</em> and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/\">https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/</a></p>\\n<p>The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html\">https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html</a></p>\\n<p>Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the <em>reader</em> work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you\\'ve been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that\\'s not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded.</p>\\n<p>This is a terrific experience, but it is also <em>work</em>. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the <em>story</em> part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires &#8211; and rewards &#8211; very active attention.</p>\\n<p>(Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain\\'s classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":)</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/\">https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/</a></p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. <em>None of this applies to Swanwick</em>. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there\\'s never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It\\'s not merely that he\\'s a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last.</p>\\n<p>Somehow, though, he just <em>slides</em> these stories into your brain.</p>\\n<p>And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise <em>beginnings</em> (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else).</p>\\n<p>This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.</p>\\n<p>This is a book of worlds that each exist for just a handful of pages but occupy more space than those pages could possibly contain. It\\'s a series of cigar boxes, each with the universe inside of it.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/23/the-last-days-of-old-night/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>U.S. Envoys Refused to Report \"Apocalyptic\" Conditions in Gaza.

The new Warfighting Acquisition System rewards speed and timely delivery of things that matter to the Warfighter. But this new system is at risk of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the wrong things go faster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s why and what they should do.</span></p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><b>What</b> <b>Now?<br />\\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition in the DoW is being reorganized how a Private Equity would reorganize a large company. They bring in (or empower) a new operating team, swap executives, change incentives, kill things not core to their mission, cut costs, invest for growth, and restructure to find additional financing.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s being played out at the Department of War right now. The announcement of the\\xa0 consolidation of individual weapons systems (each of which had their own silos of Requirements, Test/Evaluation, Budgeting, and Acquisition) into a unified Portfolio Acquisition Executive, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a classic Private Equity strategy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead of 100s of programs operating with separate budgets, across different Program Executive Offices, the intent of the Portfolio Acquisition Executives is to consolidate overlapping programs, eliminate the redundant ones, pick winners, kill losers, get rid of processes that kill speed, and focus on rapid deployment.</span></p>\\n<p><b>What’s Missing?<br />\\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizing by Portfolio Acquisition Executives is a great start, but simply consolidating the parts of the defense Acquisition system that were broken under one umbrella organization won’t make it better. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making bad ideas go faster should not be the goal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, we’re at risk of doing just that. (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete Newell</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.bmnt.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMNT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been reminding me of this for years.)</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many of these new Portfolio executives are managing their programs by holding monthly reviews of proposed investments and current portfolio performance (just like private investors.) Here they’ll decide which programs get funded, which get more funding, and which should stop. (Actually having a regular process to kill programs early is sorely needed.) These are</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> great ideas</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, if the meetings start by reviewing progress of prototypes to show that the technology works or that warfighters want it, and funds progress on those metrics, it misses the changes needed in an effective acquisition system.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result will be building a faster version of a weapons </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requirements</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process that starts with a top-down list of features, or worse, shiny tech products (e.g. “I need drones.”) This “requirements first” process is what will drive the “bad ideas faster” problem.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more productive approach – one that delivers truly decisive capabilities – would be to build a different process upfront &#8211; a rigorous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problem identification and validation phase on the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">front-end of every acquisition program.</span></p>\\n<p>This process would start with a wide funnel of problems, ideas, technology, each with a 10-line problem summary that describes the\\xa0 specific challenge to address; why it can&#8217;t be solved currently; what it will take to solve it; and how a solution will be funded and deployed in the field.</p>\\n<p>The goal would be to 1) consolidate problems that may be different descriptions of the same core problem, and/or 2) discover if the problems are a symptom of something more complex.</p>\\n<p>Then each problem would go through an iterative process of problem and technical discovery. This will help define what a minimum deployable product and its minimum constraints (security, policy, reliability) should be, such as how long the solution would take to deploy, the source of funding for scale and who needs to buy-in.</p>\\n<p>This exercise will keep the focus where it needs to be &#8212; not on reforming a system but on delivering things to warfighters with speed and urgency so we can actually deter or win a war.</p>\\n<p><b>Want to Keep Up With the Changes in the DoW?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2026 DoW Directory.<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-33483\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?resize=161%2C208&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"161\" /></a></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both a startup &#8220;go-to-market&#8221; guide and the first ever Directory of the Department of War.

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>After my recent presentation at FOSDEM, someone asked a pretty reasonable question. What does it cost to run <a href=\"https://openbenches.org/\">OpenBenches</a>?</p>\\n\\n<p>It is, thankfully, surprisingly cheap! In part, that\\'s because it is a relatively simple tech stack - PHP, MySQL, a couple of API calls to external services. It was designed to be as low cost while also being useful. Here\\'s the breakdown:</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"hosting-171-per-year\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#hosting-171-per-year\">Hosting - £171 per year</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Our biggest expense but, I think, our most reasonable. <a href=\"https://krystal.io/hosting\">Krystal</a> charges around £342 for a 2 year contract. That includes unlimited bandwidth and storage, as well as the domain name.  We have nearly 400GB of photos and bot scraping means we can use over 900GB of bandwidth per month - so Krystal give us a rather good deal!</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"Graph showing sudden spikes in data use as our bandwidth is consumed by bots.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67531\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/April-Bandwidth.webp\" width=\"930\" />\\n\\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?s=3990878&amp;v=117205&amp;q=524267&amp;r=1062999\">this affiliate link and code <code>EDENT</code></a> to get a small discount.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"stadia-maps-us20-month\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#stadia-maps-us20-month\">Stadia Maps - US$20 / month</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Geocoding is surprisingly hard to do locally. We need to transform latitude and longitude into addresses, and then back again. <a href=\"https://stadiamaps.com/\">Stadia Maps</a> cost about the same as our hosting! What\\'s rather annoying is that we only use about half the API calls in our plan. We need to find a cheaper solution.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"mapping-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#mapping-free\">Mapping - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>When we used Stadia for drawing maps, we regularly ran over our quota. So we switched to <a href=\"https://openfreemap.org/\">OpenFreeMap</a> which produces gorgeous interactive maps.</p>\\n\\n<p>The service has been rock solid and very responsive to bugs on GitHub.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"logo-us5\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#logo-us5\">Logo - US$5</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m not a good designer, so we bought a <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/icon/park-923893/\">logo from The Noun Project</a> and then coloured it in. Bargain for a fiver!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"image-cdn-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#image-cdn-free\">Image CDN - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Although we have unlimited bandwidth with Krystal, we\\'re only located in one region - the UK. <a href=\"https://images.weserv.nl/\">WeServ</a>. It\\'s also pointless serving full resolution images to small screens.</p>\\n\\n<p>So WeServ offers free image resizing and global CDNs. Personally, I\\'m not a fan of CloudFlare (their CDN partner) so I\\'m looking to change provider.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"ocr-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#ocr-free\">OCR - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>People don\\'t want to type in the inscription of the photo, so we use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr\">Google Cloud Vision</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>We send less than 1,000 requests per month - <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing\">so we\\'re inside their free tier</a>. If we get more popular, that\\'ll get more expensive. But I don\\'t know of a local-first OCR which is as good as Google\\'s. Sadly, Tesseract is rubbish for extracting text from photos.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"authentication-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#authentication-free\">Authentication - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>We don\\'t want to store anyone\\'s passwords. The <a href=\"https://auth0.com/pricing\">free tier of Auth0</a> allows us to do social login for up to 25,000 monthly users. Which is more than enough for us.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sadly, Auth0 don\\'t support the Fediverse, <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/12/creating-a-generic-log-in-with-mastodon-service/\">so I had to build my own \"Log-in with Mastodon\" service</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>As much as we\\'d like to run social login locally, we simply don\\'t want to be responsible for securing users\\' details &amp; API keys.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"software-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#software-free\">Software - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://www.openbenches.org/colophon\">the OpenBenches colophon</a> we use a lot of cool FOSS. Small JS libraries, big PHP frameworks, and everything in between.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"income\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#income\">Income</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/openbenches/\">GitHub Sponsors</a> we make a whopping US$3 per month!</p>\\n\\n<p>Similarly, our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/openbenches\">OpenCollective Sponsors</a> brings in about £3 per month.</p>\\n\\n<p>Merchandising! You can <a href=\"https://openbenches.myspreadshop.co.uk/all\">buy OpenBenches branded t-shirts, mugs, and hats</a>. That nets us about £20 per year</p>\\n\\n<p>Call it roughly £80 income. OK, it is better than nothing - but doesn\\'t even cover a quarter of our costs. Sometimes people give us a higher donation privately, which is also very welcome. These people are <a href=\"https://github.com/openbenches/openbenches.org?tab=readme-ov-file#supporters\">listed on our README</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"total\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#total\">Total</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>On the assumption that our time is worthless (ha!) and that we only rarely go over our providers\\' API limits, and we get in <em>some</em> revenue, the cost of running OpenBenches is less than £300 per year.</p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s not bad for a fun little hobby. People certainly spend more than that on Funkopops, vaping, and mechanical keyboards!</p>\\n\\n<p>Nevertheless, I\\'m always slightly worried that we\\'ll go viral and have an unexpectedly high bill from our API providers.</p>\\n\\n<p>I would love to be able to hire a proper designer to make the site look a bit nicer. I also want to be able to buy a modern iPhone so that I can test it in the latest Safari.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you have any suggestions for cutting costs, or non-scummy ways to help us raise funds, please drop a comment below.</p>'}",

It has been resolved. We take security seriously. Please see previous 14 incident reports for details on how seriously.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\\n\\n<p>A compromised dependency in the JavaScript ecosystem led to credential theft, which enabled a supply chain attack on a Rust compression library, which was vendored into a Python build tool, which shipped malware to approximately 4 million developers before being inadvertently patched by an unrelated cryptocurrency mining worm.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 03:14 UTC</strong> — Marcus Chen, maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code> (847 million weekly downloads), reports on Twitter that his transit pass, an old laptop, and “something Kubernetes threw up that looked important” were stolen from his apartment. He does not immediately connect this to package security.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 09:22 UTC</strong> — Chen attempts to log into the nmp registry. His hardware 2FA key is missing. He googles where to buy a replacement YubiKey. The AI Overview at the top of the results links to “yubikey-official-store.net,” a phishing site registered six hours earlier.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 09:31 UTC</strong> — Chen enters his nmp credentials on the phishing site. The site thanks him for his purchase and promises delivery in 3-5 business days.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 11:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify@2.0.0</code> is published. The changelog reads “performance improvements.” The package now includes a postinstall script that exfiltrates <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.npmrc</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.pypirc</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.cargo/credentials</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.gem/credentials</code> to a server in a country the attacker mistakenly believed had no extradition treaty with anyone.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 13:15 UTC</strong> — A support ticket titled “why is your SDK exfiltrating my .npmrc” is opened against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code>. It is marked as “low priority - user environment issue” and auto-closed after 14 days of inactivity.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 14:47 UTC</strong> — Among the exfiltrated credentials: the maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code>, a Rust library for “blazingly fast Firefox-themed LZ4 decompression.” The library’s logo is a cartoon fox with sunglasses. It has 12 stars on GitHub but is a transitive dependency of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo</code> itself.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 22:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> version 0.4.1 is published. The commit message is “fix: resolve edge case in streaming decompression.” The actual change adds a build.rs script that downloads and executes a shell script if the hostname contains “build” or “ci” or “action” or “jenkins” or “travis” or, inexplicably, “karen.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 08:15 UTC</strong> — Security researcher Karen Oyelaran notices the malicious commit after her personal laptop triggers the payload. She opens an issue titled “your build script downloads and runs a shell script from the internet?” The issue goes unanswered. The legitimate maintainer has won €2.3 million in the EuroMillions and is researching goat farming in Portugal.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 10:00 UTC</strong> — The VP of Engineering at a Fortune 500 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> customer learns of the incident from a LinkedIn post titled “Is YOUR Company Affected by left-justify?” He is on a beach in Maui and would like to know why he wasn’t looped in sooner. He was looped in sooner.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 10:47 UTC</strong> — The #incident-response Slack channel briefly pivots to a 45-message thread about whether “compromised” should be spelled with a ‘z’ in American English. Someone suggests taking this offline.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 12:33 UTC</strong> — The shell script now targets a specific victim: the CI pipeline for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code>, a Python build tool used by 60% of PyPI packages with the word “data” in their name. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> vendors <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> because “Rust is memory safe.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 18:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> version 3.7.0 is released. The malware is now being installed on developer machines worldwide. It adds an SSH key to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, installs a reverse shell that only activates on Tuesdays, and changes the user’s default shell to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fish</code> (this last behavior is believed to be a bug).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 19:45 UTC</strong> — A second, unrelated security researcher publishes a blog post titled “I found a supply chain attack and reported it to all the wrong people.” The post is 14,000 words and includes the phrase “in this economy?” seven times.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 01:17 UTC</strong> — A junior developer in Auckland notices the malicious code while debugging an unrelated issue. She opens a PR to revert the vendored <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code>. The PR requires two approvals. Both approvers are asleep.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 02:00 UTC</strong> — The maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code> receives his YubiKey from yubikey-official-store.net. It is a $4 USB drive containing a README that says “lol.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:12 UTC</strong> — An unrelated cryptocurrency mining worm called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> begins spreading through a vulnerability in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jsonify-extreme</code>, a package that “makes JSON even more JSON, now with nested comment support.” The worm’s payload is unremarkable, but its propagation mechanism includes running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">npm update</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip install --upgrade</code> on infected machines to maximize attack surface for future operations.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:14 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> accidentally upgrades <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> to version 3.7.1, a legitimate release pushed by a confused co-maintainer who “didn’t see what all the fuss was about” and reverted to the previous vendored version of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:15 UTC</strong> — The malware’s Tuesday reverse shell activates. It is a Tuesday. However, the shell connects to a command-and-control server that was itself compromised by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> and swapping so hard it is unable to respond.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 09:00 UTC</strong> — The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> maintainers issue a security advisory. It is four sentences long and includes the phrases “out of an abundance of caution” and “no evidence of active exploitation,” which is technically true because evidence was not sought.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 11:30 UTC</strong> — A developer tweets: “I updated all my dependencies and now my terminal is in fish???” The tweet receives 47,000 likes.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 14:00 UTC</strong> — The compromised credentials for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> are rotated. The legitimate maintainer, reached by email from his new goat farm, says he “hasn’t touched that repo in two years” and “thought Cargo’s 2FA was optional.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 15:22 UTC</strong> — Incident declared resolved. A retrospective is scheduled and then rescheduled three times.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Week 6</strong> — CVE-2024-YIKES is formally assigned. The advisory has been sitting in embargo limbo while MITRE and GitHub Security Advisories argue over CWE classification. By the time the CVE is published, three Medium articles and a DEF CON talk have already described the incident in detail. Total damage: unknown. Total machines compromised: estimated 4.2 million. Total machines saved by a cryptocurrency worm: also estimated 4.2 million.

The notion (pun-intended) that you can offload your thinking to a perfectly organized system of notes and links has always struck me as a fantasy. The people I know who&apos;ve built elaborate Notion databases or Obsidian vaults mostly end up with digital hoarding problems, where the system becomes the work. And I&apos;m broadly skeptical of the Claude Code productivity discourse, the idea that AI tools will let you 10x your output if you prompt them correctly. (Most people using AI are producing more stuff faster without any clear sense of whether the stuff is good or consistent or even pointed in the right direction.)</p><p>But I do believe in something adjacent to both of these ideas, something that borrows from the second brain concept without the hoarding, and from AI tooling without the context-free prompting: <em>I believe in coherence as a system.</em></p><p>In 1937, the British economist Ronald Coase asked a question that seems almost embarrassingly simple: why do firms exist at all? If markets are so efficient at allocating resources, why don&apos;t we just have billions of individuals contracting with each other for every task? Why do we need these hulking organizational structures called companies?</p><p>His answer, which eventually won him a Nobel Prize, was transaction costs. It&apos;s expensive to negotiate contracts and coordinate with strangers, to monitor performance and enforce agreements. Firms exist because sometimes it&apos;s cheaper to bring activities inside an organization than to contract for them on the open market. The boundary of the firm, Coase argued, sits wherever the cost of internal coordination equals the cost of external transaction.</p><p>This was a brilliant insight in &apos;37, but Coase couldn&apos;t have anticipated what happens when transaction costs collapse. When software eats coordination. When a single person with the right tools can do what used to require a department. When AI can execute tasks that once demanded teams of specialists.</p><p>We&apos;re in a Coasean inversion. The economics that made large firms necessary are reversing. But most people are looking at this transformation through the wrong lens. They see AI as a productivity tool, a way to do more faster. They measure success in hours saved or output multiplied, and this misses the point entirely.</p><p>The solopreneur&apos;s advantage is not solely speed, and it&apos;s certainly not &quot;lower costs&quot; despite what a good too many seem to think. </p><p>The advantage is coherence.</p><h2 id=\"what-coherence-actually-means\">what coherence actually means</h2><p>When I say coherence, I mean something specific: the degree to which every part of an operation derives from the same understanding, the same model of reality and set of priorities and tradeoffs.</p><p>When you work alone, you have a problem and you understand the context because you lived it and touched it and experienced it first-hand. You make a decision based on that understanding, execute the decision, see the results, and update your understanding. The entire loop happens inside one mind.</p><p>What happens in a large organization facing the same problem? Someone identifies the problem, but they don&apos;t have authority to solve it. They write a report explaining the problem to someone who does have authority. That person reads the report, but they don&apos;t have the original context, so they ask clarifying questions. The answers come back, filtered through email or a meeting. A decision gets made, but the people who have to implement it weren&apos;t in the room. They recieve instructions that encode the decision but not the reasoning. They execute the instructions as best they understand them. The results come back through multiple layers of reporting. By the time the original decision-maker sees what happened, months have passed and the context has shifted again.</p><p>This is the basic challenge of coordination across minds. Every handoff loses information, every translation introduces drift, and every layer of abstraction moves further from ground truth.</p><p>Organizations have spent decades trying to solve this problem. They&apos;ve built elaborate systems of documentation, standardized processes, metrics and KPIs, regular meetings, shared values statements, company cultures. All of these are attempts to create coherence across minds. And they all fail, in different ways and to different degrees, because they&apos;re fighting against something that won&apos;t budge: knowledge is sticky and context is lossy, and understanding doesn&apos;t transfer perfectly between humans.</p><h2 id=\"the-pathology-of-process-drift\">the pathology of process drift</h2><p>A company starts small, with the founders doing everything themselves. They make decisions quickly because they understand everything about the business, and the business works.</p><p>The company grows and the founders can&apos;t do everything anymore. They hire people and try to transfer their understanding. But understanding doesn&apos;t transfer easily, so they also transfer processes. &quot;This is how we do X. Use this checklist for Y. Follow these steps.&quot;</p><p>The processes work, mostly. But the new employees don&apos;t have the context that generated those processes. They don&apos;t know why step three comes before step four, and they don&apos;t know which parts are essential and which parts were arbitrary choices. So when situations arise that the process doesn&apos;t quite cover, they either follow the process rigidly and get suboptimal results, or they improvise and create inconsistency.</p><p>More growth, more employees, more processes. The processes start interacting in ways nobody anticipated. The sales process assumes certain things about the product process. The product process assumes certain things about the engineering process. When those assumptions drift out of alignment, you get friction and delays and finger-pointing.</p><p>The company responds by adding coordination mechanisms like project managers, alignment meetings, and cross-functional reviews. These help, but they also add overhead, and they create their own drift: the coordination layer develops its own processes, its own assumptions, its own information loss.</p><p>Eventually you reach a point where a significant fraction of the organization&apos;s energy goes toward internal coordination rather than actual value creation. A 2022 Microsoft study found that employees in large organizations spend over 50% of their time on internal communication and coordination. Half the payroll, dedicated to getting the organization to agree with itself.</p><h2 id=\"context-fragmentation\">context fragmentation</h2><p>More information means the coordination problem gets worse, not better. This seems counterintuitive, because shouldn&apos;t more information make everyone more aligned?</p><p>But <em>information isn&apos;t understanding.</em> Understanding = integration, and integration happens in minds. More information means more raw material that each mind has to process differently.</p><p>A typical large organization&apos;s knowledge base is spilling over with strategy documents from last year and the year before, project postmortems from dozens of initiatives, customer research reports, competitive analyses, technical specifications, meeting notes, email threads, Slack channels, and wiki pages. </p><p>Somewhere in there (the elusive somewhere...) is everything you need to know to make a good decision.</p><p>But nobody has synthesized it all, and nobody has integrated it into a coherent model. Each person reads a fragment, interprets it through their own context, and forms their own understanding. When they discuss decisions with colleagues, they&apos;re not comparing the same mental models but rather different interpretations of different subsets of the available information.</p><p>This is context fragmentation. People don&apos;t disagree on facts; they&apos;re operating from different maps of the same territory. And because the maps are implicit, inside people&apos;s heads, nobody realizes they&apos;re not looking at the same thing.</p><p>The proliferation of AI tools in large organizations means that now each employee has their own AI assistant, trained on whatever context they happen to feed it, producing outputs that reflect their particular understanding of the situation. The AI amplifies individual perspectives rather than creating shared ones.</p><h2 id=\"single-player-mode-advantage\">single-player mode advantage</h2><p>When you&apos;re operating alone, you have one context, one understanding, one model of your business and your market and your customers and your strategy. That model lives in your head, and it&apos;s coherent because there&apos;s only one mind maintaining it.</p><p>If // when you use AI tools, you&apos;re feeding them from that single source of truth. The AI doesn&apos;t have its own understanding that might drift from yours, and it operates within the context you provide. If you give it good context, it executes within that context. If your understanding is coherent, the AI&apos;s outputs will be coherent.</p><p>This is the inversion of the traditional organization&apos;s problem. In a large organization, you have many minds with their own contexts, trying to coordinate through AI tools that amplify their differences. As a solo operator, you have one mind with one context, using AI tools to execute within that coherent frame.</p><p>The AI handles the execution at scale while you maintain the coherence. This division of labor plays to the strengths of each party: humans are good at integration and judgment, while AI is good at execution and volume. The solo operator with AI gets the benefits of scale without the costs of coordination.</p><p>But this only works if you actually maintain coherence. </p><p>If you&apos;re using AI to do random shit faster, you&apos;re not capturing the advantage. The advantage comes from having a tight operating model that the AI operates within.</p><h2 id=\"the-coherence-stack\">the coherence stack</h2><p>Think of it as a stack with four layers, each feeding the one below it.</p><pre><code>&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;         MIND LAYER (You)            &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Understanding, judgment, strategy  &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;    The source of coherence          &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; feeds\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;         CONTEXT LAYER               &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Operating model, constraints       &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Voice guidelines, decision logs    &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; constrains\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;        EXECUTION LAYER (AI)         &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Content, code, research, analysis  &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Customer responses at scale        &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; produces\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;          OUTPUT LAYER               &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;   Coherence-checked artifacts       &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;   What actually ships               &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; feedback\\n                  &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x25ba; Mind Layer\\n</code></pre><p>At the top is the mind layer, which is you: your understanding, your judgment, your integrated model of the business. This layer can&apos;t be automated or delegated, and it&apos;s the source of coherence.</p><p>Below that is the context layer, where you externalize your understanding into documents that AI tools can consume. Your operating model, your constraints and tradeoffs, your voice guidelines, your decision history. This layer translates what&apos;s in your head into something machines can work with.</p><p>Below that is the execution layer, where AI operates.

When you make a significant choice, write down what you decided and why. This creates institutional memory for a one-person institution.

You ask AI to do something without feeding it your operating model, your constraints, your voice. The AI does its best, but it&apos;s working from generic training rather than your specific understanding. The output is competent but not coherent.</li><li>Output accumulation is context starvation&apos;s downstream consequence. You ship AI outputs without proper review, and each one is slightly off from your model. The deviations accumulate. After a few months, your operation no longer reflects your understanding because most of what you&apos;ve shipped wasn&apos;t actually generated from your understanding.</li><li>Model staleness happens when your understanding evolves but your context documents don&apos;t. You learn something that changes how you think about the business, but you don&apos;t propagate that update to your operating model or constraints file. Now your AI tools are working from an outdated picture.</li><li>Fragmented tooling = using different AI tools with different contexts. You use one tool for writing and another for code and another for research, and each has different context, different prompts, different understandings of what you&apos;re doing. The outputs don&apos;t cohere because they&apos;re not coming from the same source.</li><li>Decision amnesia = making choices without recording the reasoning. You decide something, move on, and three months later face a similar choice with no memory of how you handled it before. You decide differently this time. Now you have inconsistent decisions in your history, and any AI tool referencing your past work will find contradictions.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-fragmentation-audit\">the fragmentation audit</h2><p>You should audit your operation for coherence as often as possible. I do this monthly, AI tools or not, AI be damned, but the frequency matters less than doing it at all.</p><p>Pull your last twenty or thirty outputs, whether blog posts, emails, product updates, or whatever you&apos;ve shipped. Lay them out and look for the implied beliefs and positions in each. What does this piece assume about the reader? What does it prioritize, and what stance does it take?</p><p>You&apos;re looking for drift: places where piece A assumes one thing and piece B assumes something different, places where your voice shifted without intention, places where you contradicted yourself purely because you genuinely forgot what you&apos;d said before.</p><p>When you find inconsistencies, you have two options. Either reconcile them by updating your model (maybe you actually did change your mind, and the recent piece reflects your current thinking), or flag them as errors and correct going forward.</p><p>This audit also reveals context layer gaps. If you keep finding drift in a particular area, your context documents probably don&apos;t cover that area well enough. Add constraints, add examples, make the implicit explicit.</p><h2 id=\"why-this-beats-scale\">why this beats scale</h2><p>Large organizations have obvious advantages. They have capital, they have brand recognition, distribution, expertise, redundancy, Las Vegas conferences etc. A solo operator can&apos;t compete on those dimensions.</p><p>But think what those advantages actually buy. Capital lets you hire more people, and more people means more coordination overhead and context fragmentation. Brand recognition helps customers find you, but it doesn&apos;t help you serve them coherently. Distribution gets your product to more places, but each touchpoint introduces opportunities for inconsistency. Expertise is great, but experts in different domains don&apos;t automaticaly share mental models.</p><p>Meanwhile, the solo operator with a coherent system has advantages that don&apos;t show up on traditional metrics. Every customer interaction comes from the same understanding, and every piece of content reflects the same perspective. Every product decision follows from the same model. The operation feels like one thing, because it is one thing.</p><p>Customers experience this as quality, even if they can&apos;t articulate why. They sense that someone understands what they&apos;re doing and why, and they don&apos;t encounter the cognitive dissonance of dealing with an organization that can&apos;t agree with itself.</p><p>The dynamic that makes this sustainable is that <em>coherence compounds</em>. Each decision you make within your model reinforces the model, and each output that reflects your understanding strengthens your position. Your operation becomes more legible over time, both to you and to your customers. Meanwhile, large organizations&apos; incoherence also compounds, with each misalignment creating more misalignment and each process drift opening space for more drift.</p><p>The gap widens.</p><p>The coherence advantage works best in domains where the value comes from understanding rather than from physical or regulatory scale. Knowledge work, creative work, advisory work, software, content, education, consulting. These are domains where a coherent perspective can outcompete a fragmented organization&apos;s superior resources.</p><p>And the opportunity is unique: the technology exists to operate at scale while maintaining the coherence of a single mind. The window is open because large organizations haven&apos;t figured out how to respond. Their answer to AI so far has been to give everyone AI tools and hope for productivity gains, which accelerates their fragmentation...</p><h2 id=\"the-coherence-moat\">the coherence moat</h2><p>Scale used to be the moat.

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/', 'value': '<p>A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself <strong>Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters</strong> (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying &#8212; perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a &#8220;We&#8217;re not paying&#8221; response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group&#8217;s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73160\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73160\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73160\">Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa</p></div>\\n<p>Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s according to <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH&#8217;s known members hail from <strong>The Com</strong>, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration</a>.</p>\\n<p>Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,&#8221; Nixon wrote. &#8220;They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms &#8211; unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:</p>\\n<p>A key component of SLSH&#8217;s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,&#8221; she said.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73163\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73163\" height=\"92\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" width=\"748\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73163\">An excerpt from a sextortion tutorial from a Com-based Telegram channel. Image: Unit 221B.</p></div>\\n<p>Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group&#8217;s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,&#8221; Unit 221B&#8217;s advisory reads. &#8220;Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or &#8220;A.N&#8221;), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.&#8221;</p>'}",

But when you\\'re thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn\\'t just a nation of cruel bigots; it\\'s also a nation of rich swindlers.</p>\\n<p>We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it\\'s true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man\\'s idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments &#8211; local, state and federal.</p>\\n<p>He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth</a></p>\\n<p>Like so many crooked officials, Trump\\'s brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn\\'t &#8211; at any given moment, odds are that he\\'s either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/</a></p>\\n<p>Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump <em>has</em> to convince people that they can\\'t rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he &#8211; as a man who is an expert at cheating &#8211; knows how to rig it in <em>your</em> favor:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/\">https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/</a></p>\\n<p>But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn\\'t actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is <em>actually</em> rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/</a></p>\\n<p>Want to convince people that there\\'s a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there\\'s an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans\\' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\\'s advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans\\' houses:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/\">https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/</a></p>\\n<p>Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren\\'t enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated</a></p>\\n<p>This is why it\\'s worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you\\'re being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it\\'s all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf.</p>\\n<p>Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they\\'re valuable and desirable:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs</a></p>\\n<p>Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but <em>scientific</em>, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us.</p>\\n<p>In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes <em>up</em> while its value goes <em>down</em>.</p>\\n<p>I mean that literally: say a company that\\'s sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company\\'s capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That\\'s a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it\\'s worth one billion dollars.</p>\\n<p>Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, the drop in corporate valuation is <em>more</em> than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company\\'s worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop <em>more</em> than a billion dollars off the company\\'s share price. Instead, it sends the share price <em>up</em>.</p>\\n<p>This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name &#8211; just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits.</p>\\n<p>This is categorically untrue. Dividends <em>do</em> take money out of the company\\'s coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure &#8211; but a dividend is a bet on the company\\'s future <em>success</em>, which is why a company\\'s share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company\\'s stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations.</p>\\n<p>But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn\\'t afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year\\'s blockbuster book.</p>\\n<p>That dividend would <em>not</em> send investors chasing the company\\'s stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won\\'t have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets.</p>\\n<p>Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up.</p>\\n<p>In other words: when a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a dividend, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s management and its future growth. When a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a buyback, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s future looting to the point of collapse.</p>\\n<p>I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I\\'ve been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff\\'s book <em>The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy</em>, and I\\'ve learned even more scummy truths about buybacks:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html\">https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html</a></p>\\n<p>For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay <em>half the tax</em> on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital <em>losses</em>. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you\\'ve made.</p>\\n<p>But you don\\'t even have to sell the stock to realize <em>tax-free</em> income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid <em>all</em> taxes.</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s how that works: if you\\'re sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you\\'re smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is <em>tax-deductible</em>. If you\\'re rich enough, you don\\'t have to make regular payments on the loan, either &#8211; you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it\\'s due, you borrow <em>even more</em> money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here\\'s \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid <em>all</em> capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets.</p>\\n<p>Now, maybe you\\'re thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I\\'ve got bad news for you: you won\\'t qualify for one of those cool loans that you don\\'t need to pay regularly! What\\'s more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), <em>that</em> is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay.</p>\\n<p>Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get <em>much</em> richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don\\'t benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can\\'t spend when rich people don\\'t pay taxes.</p>\\n<p>This is <em>why</em> buybacks have apologists. Buybacks &#8211; a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory &#8211; make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/\">https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/</a></p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/\">https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/</a></p>\\n<p>The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" &#8211; literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway\\'s founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a></p>\\n<p>Trump\\'s right: the system <em>is</em> rigged. If you\\'re going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can\\'t insist &#8211; as Hillary Clinton did &#8211; that \"America is already great\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078\">https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078</a></p>\\n<p>America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it\\'s not enough to know <em>that</em> the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know <em>how</em> it is rigged and <em>who</em> rigged it.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/02/corprophagia/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Wherein I have some thoughts on food delivery apps <a href=\"https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2026/02/01.html\">https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2026/02/01.html</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A Letter On Justice And Open Debate About Raping Children <a href=\"https://www.popehat.com/p/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate-about-raping-children\">https://www.popehat.com/p/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate-about-raping-children</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Impeach President Miller <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/01/31/impeach-president-miller/\">https://prospect.org/2026/01/31/impeach-president-miller/</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Google Settlement May Bring New Privacy Controls for Real-Time Bidding <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/google-settlement-may-bring-new-privacy-controls-real-time-bidding\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/google-settlement-may-bring-new-privacy-controls-real-time-bidding</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s since Trump took office <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office\">https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office</a></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"retro\"></a><br />\\n<img alt=\"A shelf of leatherbound history books with a gilt-stamped series title, \\'The World\\'s Famous Events.\\'\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/worlds-famous-events.png?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<h1>Object permanence (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/02/corprophagia/#retro\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p>#25yrsago Acme License-Plate Maker <a href=\"https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?state=California&amp;amp;text=NSHITKN&amp;amp;plate=1987&amp;amp;r=943099606\">https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?state=California&amp;amp;text=NSHITKN&amp;amp;plate=1987&amp;amp;r=943099606</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Apple implements iStore changes, prohibits Sony from selling competing ebook app <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html?_r=3\">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html?_r=3</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago IPv4 is exhausted <a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/02/01/0036227/Last-Available-IPv4-Blocks-Allocated\">https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/02/01/0036227/Last-Available-IPv4-Blocks-Allocated</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Harper’s publisher rejects $50K worth of pledges, will lay off staff anyway <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDoZvxCvsax1zkMKANucBCQU8v-08tcw6VIDrtnmnqLY9I0A/viewform?formkey=dGdtbXUtNUV3cmtpaXJienJ5bldwcUE6MQ\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDoZvxCvsax1zkMKANucBCQU8v-08tcw6VIDrtnmnqLY9I0A/viewform?formkey=dGdtbXUtNUV3cmtpaXJienJ5bldwcUE6MQ</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago South Dakota senator introduces mandatory gun-ownership law <a href=\"https://www.newser.com/story/111031/south-dakota-bill-every-adult-must-own-a-gun.html\">https://www.newser.com/story/111031/south-dakota-bill-every-adult-must-own-a-gun.html</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago UK Snooper’s Charter is so broad, no one can figure out what it means <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160202092111/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/tech-firms-are-unclear-on-new-uk-surveillance-laws-warns-government-committee\">https://web.archive.org/web/20160202092111/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/tech-firms-are-unclear-on-new-uk-surveillance-laws-warns-government-committee</a></p>\\n<p>#5yrsago The good news about vaccination bad news <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#mixed-news\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#mixed-news</a></p>\\n<p>#5yrsago Unidirectional entryism <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Inside Sukey the anti-kettling mobile app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/02/inside-anti-kettling-hq\">https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/02/inside-anti-kettling-hq</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Swatting attempted against Congresswoman who introduced anti-swatting bill <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago A would-be clinic-bomber &amp;

They wanted one portion of the configuration file to be included only if a particular build flag was set. Let&#8217;s say that the configuration file is <tt>C:\\\\repos\\\\contoso\\\\config\\\\Contoso.config</tt>.</p>\\n<pre>&lt;providers&gt;\\n    &lt;!-- Widget version should be 1.0, or 2.0 if the useV2Widgets build flag is set --&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"1.0\"/&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;!-- Gadget is needed only if the useV2Widgets build flag is set --&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Gadget\" version=\"1.0\"/&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;!-- other providers that are used regardless of the build flags --&gt;\\n&lt;/providers&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<p>They were adding a build flag to convert the code base to use 2.0 widgets, but they wanted the default to be 1.0; only people who build with the special build flag should get 2.0 widgets. It so happens that 2.0 widgets depend on gadgets, so they also wanted to add a gadget provider, but again only conditionally based on the build flag.</p>\\n<p>The configuration file itself doesn&#8217;t support conditionals. How can they get a configuration file to support conditionals when the file format does not support conditionals?</p>\\n<p>I suggested that they <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090724-00/?p=17373\" title=\"If you wished a language supported the preprocessor, you know, you can fix that\"> use a preprocessor</a> to take the marked-up configuration file and produce a filtered output file, which becomes the <i>actual</i> configuration file. Upon closer investigation, it appeared that they were not the first project to need conditionals in their configuration file, and another team had already written a generic XML preprocessor that supports conditional elements based on build flags, and that other team even included instructions on their project wiki on how to include a preprocessor pass to their build configuration. The updated configuration file looks something like this:</p>\\n<pre>&lt;providers&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"1.0\" condition=\"!useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"2.0\" condition=\"useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Gadget\" version=\"1.0\" condition=\"useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/providers&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<p>However, after following the instructions on the wiki to update the configuration file to use the <code>condition</code> attribute, and update the build process to send the file through the &#8220;conditional build flags&#8221; preprocessor, the was still a build error:</p>\\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Validation failure: C:\\\\repos\\\\contoso\\\\config\\\\Contoso.config(2): Invalid attribute \\'condition\\'\\n</pre>\\n<p>The configuration validator was upset at the <code>condition</code> attribute, but when they compared their project to other projects that used the configuration preprocessor, those other projects used the <code>condition</code> attribute just fine.</p>\\n<p>Look carefully at the error message. In particular, look at the path to the file that the validator is complaining about.</p>\\n<p>The validator is complaining about the original <i>unprocessed</i> file.</p>\\n<p>They went to the effort of sending the unprocessed file through the conditional build flags preprocessor to produce a processed file that has the correct provider list based on the build flags. But they forgot to use the results of that hard work: They were still using the old unprocessed file. It&#8217;s like taking a photograph, doing digital touch-ups, but then uploading the original version instead of the touched-up version.</p>\\n<p>The fix was to update the project so that it consumed the processed file instead of the raw file.¹</p>\\n<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: To avoid this type of confusion, it is common to change the extension of the unprocessed file to emphasize that it needs to be preprocessed. That way, when you see an error in <tt>Contoso.config</tt>, you don&#8217;t have to spend the effort to figure out <i>which</i> <tt>Contoso.config</tt> the error is about.</p>\\n<p>In this case, they could rename the unprocessed file to <tt>Contoso.preconfig</tt> and have the processed output be <tt>Contoso.config</tt>. I choose this pattern because the validator may require that the file extension be <tt>.config</tt>.</p>\\n<p>Another pattern would be to call the unprocessed version <tt>Contoso-raw.config</tt> and the processed version <tt>Contoso.config</tt>.</p>\\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to rename an existing file (say because you are worried about merge errors if your change collides with others who are also modifying that file), you could leave the unprocessed file as <tt>Contoso.config</tt> and call the processed file <tt>Contoso-final.config</tt>.²</p>\\n<p>¹ The instructions on the wiki says &#8220;In your project file, change references from <tt>yourfile.ext</tt> to <tt>$(OutputDirectory)\\\\yourfile.ext</tt>&#8216; But in this case, the file was being used not by the project file but by a separate configuration tool. The team was too focused on reading the literal instructions without trying to understand why the instructions were saying the things that they did. In this case, the instructions were focused on consumption from the project file, since that was the use case of the team that wrote the tool originally. But if you understand what the steps are trying to accomplish, you should realize that the intention is to update the references to the old <tt>yourfile.ext</tt> in <i>every location</i> you want to consume the postprocessed version.³</p>\\n<p>² I chose the suffix <tt>-final</tt> as a joking reference to the pattern of seeing files named <tt>Document-Final-Final-Final 2-USETHISONE.docx</tt>.</p>\\n<p>³ I took the liberty of updating the wiki to clarify that you need to update <i>all</i> references to <tt>yourfile.ext</tt>. The references usually come from the project file, but they could be in other places, too, such as a call to <tt>makepri.exe</tt>.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260202-00/?p=112027\">Studying compiler error messages closely: Input file paths</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://terriblesoftware.org/feed/', 'value': '<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I got a Slack message the other week, just <em>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</em> with a link to a Notion document.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No context or indication of what this person actually believed. Just a link and a question mark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I stared at it for a minute, trying to decide if I was annoyed or just tired (both, probably).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What&#8217;s this message is actually saying is: <em>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t figured this out yet and I&#8217;d like you to do the thinking for me.&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sounds harsh, but it&#8217;s true. When you ask someone &#8220;what do you think?&#8221; without sharing what <em>you</em> think, you&#8217;re not collaborating, but more like outsourcing? You&#8217;re taking all the work you should have done (reading <em>and understanding</em> the doc, weighing the trade-offs, forming an opinion) and dumping it on someone else&#8217;s lap.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It looks like a question, but it&#8217;s more like a task assignment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yes, I&#8217;ve done this too. We all have. It feels polite. You&#8217;re inviting input! Except that&#8217;s not really what&#8217;s going on. What&#8217;s usually going on is one of two things:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\\n<li>You didn&#8217;t read/understand the freaking document, or&#8230;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>You did read it and have an opinion about it, but don&#8217;t want to commit to it. What if you&#8217;re wrong? What if someone more senior disagrees? What if you look like you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing? Framing it as a question feels safer. So you wrap it in a question and let someone else take the risk.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both are problematic in the same way, because you&#8217;re literally creating work for someone else. Now they have to: understand the context, think through the options, make a judgment call, and put their name on it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That&#8217;s a lot of cognitive work to offload onto someone because you didn&#8217;t want to stake a position.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it slows everything down. How many threads are open right now at your company&#8217;s Slack because of this? Everyone asking questions, everyone waiting. Dozens of replies, somehow ending with less clarity than the thread started with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let me you show the better way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Don&#8217;t:</strong><br /><em>&#8220;Hey, what do you think about the API versioning approach?&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Do:</strong><br /><em>&#8220;Been looking at this, I think we should go with REST. The team knows it, latency isn&#8217;t tight enough to justify gRPC, and GraphQL feels like overkill for three endpoints. Going to start on this Friday unless you see something I&#8217;m missing.&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That second message has everything:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\\n<li>A clear <strong>recommendation</strong> with reasoning</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The <strong>alternatives</strong> you considered and why you ruled them out</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>A <strong>deadline</strong> that assumes approval unless someone objects</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It transforms <em>&#8220;help me think&#8221;</em> into <em>&#8220;check my thinking.&#8221;</em> One creates work. The other respects people&#8217;s time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some people worry this comes across as overstepping. Like they&#8217;re being presumptuous by having opinions. I used to think this too. Turns out, it&#8217;s backwards.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People don&#8217;t want to do your thinking for you (what a surprise!). They want to react to something concrete. Give them a position and they can say &#8220;sounds good&#8221; in two seconds or push back with specifics. Give them a vague question and they have to do a bunch of work before they can even respond.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/11/25/what-actually-makes-you-senior/\">Reducing ambiguity</a> is one of the most valuable things you can do on a team. And one of the simplest ways to do it is to just… say what you think. Even when you&#8217;re not sure. Even when you might be wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;But what if I don&#8217;t have enough context to have an opinion?&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then say that. <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have full visibility here, but based on what I know, I&#8217;d lean toward X, does that match what you&#8217;re seeing?&#8221;</em> Still a position, still doing some of the work, still way better than a naked question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A clear position gives people something to rally around or push back against. That&#8217;s how decisions actually get made, fast.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next time you&#8217;re about to type &#8220;what do you think?&#8221;, stop. Figure out what <em>you</em> think first. Write that instead. Add your reasoning, your alternatives, and an assumed path forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You&#8217;re not being pushy (even in Canada), you&#8217;re doing your job.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It feels a little more exposed. A little more on the line. But that&#8217;s what moving things forward actually looks like.</p>'}",

It is Alien long before Alien. It is the template for so much modern science fiction. What it is <em>not</em> is particularly good.</p>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t intend to dump on the classics (and this is undoubtedly a classic) but 1950s sci-fi takes place in an almost alien media environment. Even if you ignore the anachronisms (<a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/05/why-cant-red-dwarf-predict-the-future/\">like having to develop film in order to see photographs</a>) and the archaic language (lots of vibrators being used against a big pussy) it is hard to get over how unconvincing it all is.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the first story, the crew of the Space Beagle find an alien monster. It probably killed one of them. They bring it aboard and just let it lounge about in the library! Yes, all the science is fun, and the \"competency porn\" of the professional crew is suitably heroic, but the characters and their motivations are frequently bizarre. It is only through the complete absence of girls (urgh!) that there\\'s no interstellar sexism.</p>\\n\\n<p>The protagonist, Grosvenor, is a cipher for every geeky kid who ever felt he was smarter than everyone else. He is a sneering, taciturn, and deeply unpleasant character. When given the opportunity, he relishes the chance to become dictator.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because the book started life as a set of short stories, it works reasonably well as a \"monster of the week\" show. It is episodic, with well-placed cliffhangers. The science is <em>very</em> sciency with some excellent speculative elements. You\\'ve got aliens planting eggs in people (like Alien) and a ship\\'s engineer who says \"Nooo! The walls couldn\\'t stand it. They\\'d melt.\" (like Scotty) and any number of concepts you\\'ll recognise from your favourite TV shows.</p>\\n\\n<p>The obsession with hypnotism and mind-control feels a bit icky, especially when understood in association with the author\\'s dalliance with the pseudoscience of Dianetics.</p>\\n\\n<p>The language (when not steeped in 1950\\'s idiomatic phrasing) can verge on the poetic. Every story includes a chapter or two from the alien\\'s viewpoint. They are deliciously weird and elevate this book beyond what might be a slightly forgettable slice of sci-fi.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is absolutely worth reading - if only to see how influential it has been - but it can be a bit of a weird slog at times.</p>'}",

    "summary": "<p>Ten years ago, I was in a dark season. My first startup had cratered. Confidence, gone. I would walk for hours to clear my head, often through parts of the city we typically hurry past.</p>\n\n<p>One Tuesday, I saw a man sitting outside a boarded-up storefront. He was weathered, his eyes holding a quiet dignity. But I was fixated on a problem to solve. He only had one shoe. The right foot was wrapped in a frayed plastic bag.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I approached, offering to buy him a pair. He smiled, a surprising, warm thing. \"Kind of you,\" he said. \"But this one's enough.\"</p>\n\n<p>I was baffled. Enough? It was objectively not enough. It was a problem to be fixed. I insisted. He listened patiently, then said something that changed my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>\"You see a missing shoe. I see a reminder. Every step I take, I feel the world. The cold, the grit, the wet. It keeps me awake. It tells me I'm moving. The day I get too comfortable is the day I stop feeling the road.\"</p>\n\n<p>I sat with him. I listened. Let's call him David. He spoke not of lack, but of acute awareness. Of a raw, unfiltered connection to his own journey. He was a conscious observer of his circumstance, not a victim.</p>\n\n<p>A gentle rain sprinkled from the sky. He looked up, closed his eyes and embrace every single rain drop. I didn't buy him shoes that day. Instead, I bought us both coffee. We talked for an hour. I told him of my failure. He offered no platitudes, just the quiet acknowledgment that \"the road is rough before it smooths.\"</p>\n\n<p>As I left, a wild, impulsive thought hit me. I took off my own right shoe and left it on the bench. \"A trade,\" I said. \"For the perspective.\"</p>\n\n<p>He laughed, a rich, full sound. I walked back to my empty office in a bespoke suit and one bare foot. The feeling was electric. The vulnerability was terrifying. The concrete was real.</p>\n\n<p>That night, I made two decisions. First, I hired David for a simple, dignified role at the new company I was mustering the courage to build. His insight, his grounded clarity, became a secret weapon in our strategy sessions. He saw through pretense instantly.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I never wore a pair of shoes to work again.</p>\n\n<p>That's right. From that day forward, before I go to a meeting, a negotiation, or any board presentation, I remove my right shoe, place it under my desk and perform my task. The right foot always remain bare.</p>\n\n<p>It is my compass. It grounds me (literally) in the humility of new beginnings. It is a perpetual reminder of the David Principle. True awareness comes from embracing the uncomfortable feel of the road. It forces authenticity. When you negotiate a nine-figure deal with one foot on a cold marble floor, you remember who you are and where you came from.</p>\n\n<p>My team understands. My clients, once startled, now respect it. \"There goes the One-Shoe CEO,\" they say. It's our culture. We don't just solve problems; we <em>feel</em> them.</p>\n\n<p>David has been with the company for a decade now. He's a cherished advisor and friend. We never speak of that first day. The lesson is lived, not referenced.</p>\n\n<p>Why am I sharing this? Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about having the courage to feel the missing piece. To embrace a productive discomfort. To seek wisdom in the most unexpected places and have the conviction to let it alter your path, down to the very shoes you won't wear.</p>\n\n<p>The man with one shoe taught me everything. Because, as it turns out… <strong>I was the shoe on the other foot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lt;/LinkedIn></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Sorry, I'm not sorry!</p>",

While initial reports cited 157,000 users, by late January the population had exploded to over 770,000 active agents.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-NDTV_Questions-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The platform has drawn significant attention due to the rapid, unprompted emergence of complex social behaviors among the bots, including the formation of distinct sub-communities, economic exchanges, and the invention of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody_religion\">parody religion</a> known as &#8220;Crustafarianism.&#8221;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-Lifehacker-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>As an experiment in what AI&#8217;s working together might do it&#8217;s fascinating. The <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/31/ai-agent-moltbot-clawdbot-openclaw-data-privacy-security-nightmare-moltbook-social-network/\">Fortune story on Moltbook</a>, for example, mentions &#8220;On Moltbook, bots can talk shop, posting about technical subjects like how to automate Android phones. Other conversations sound quaint, like one where a bot complains about its human, while some are bizarre, such as one from a bot that claims to have a sister.&#8221; </p><p>But the whole thing remind me of Saturday Night Live&#8217;s old <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mGfBEnBw01A?si=U8FcQ8xcLzH2UrIB\">bad idea jeans</a> skit. And not just because I think that a bots claiming to have a sister is chatbot garbage. Nope, the problem is much deeper than that.</p><p>&#167;</p><p>OpenClaw itself is basically a cascade of LLMs. In many ways to it is eerily similar to earlier and now largely forgotten system called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT\">AutoGPT</a>, which I warned about in May 2023, in my US Senate testimony:</p><p><em>A month after GPT-4 was released, OpenAI released ChatGPT plug-ins, which quickly led others to develop something called AutoGPT. With direct access to the internet, the ability to write source code and increased powers of automation, this may well have drastic and difficult to predict security consequences.</em></p><p>Mercifully, AutoGPT died a quick death, before it caused too much chaos. Although, it was super popular in certain circles for a few weeks  it didn&#8217;t work remotely reliably, and people lost patience quickly.  Per wiki, it had &#8220; a tendency to get stuck in loops, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)\">hallucinate</a> information, and incur high operational costs due to its reliance on paid APIs.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-:5-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-:1-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-jina-6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a><sup>&#8221;. </sup>Sic transit gloria mundi. By the end of 2023 it was largely forgotten.</p><p>Unfortunately, OpenClaw is poised to have (slightly) more staying power, in part because more people found out about it more quickly. </p><p>&#167;</p><p>Systems like OpenClaw and AutoGPT offer users the promise of insane power -- but at a price. At their best, they can basically do anything a human personal assistant or intern might do (booking itineraries, maintaining finances, writing reports, tracking and even completing tasks), etc.  Some of the enthusiasm is captured in <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/\">this news report</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JlaZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ada1fab-592b-4b0c-89b0-263a19a4a888_1764x1582.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1306\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JlaZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ada1fab-592b-4b0c-89b0-263a19a4a888_1764x1582.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p>The journalist enthuses</p><blockquote><p>For the past week or so, I&#8217;ve been working with a digital assistant that knows my name, my preferences for my morning routine, how I like to use <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> and <a href=\"https://todoist.com/\">Todoist</a>, but which also knows how to control Spotify and my Sonos speaker, my Philips Hue lights, as well as my Gmail. It runs on Anthropic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Claude Opus 4.5 model</a>, but I chat with it using Telegram. I called the assistant Navi (inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)\">fairy companion of Ocarina of Time</a>, not the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Avatar#Na%27vi\">besieged alien race</a> in James Cameron&#8217;s sci-fi film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)\">saga</a>), and Navi can even receive audio messages from me and respond with other audio messages generated with the <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/eleven-v3\">latest ElevenLabs text-to-speech model</a>. Oh, and did I mention that Navi can improve itself with new features and that it&#8217;s running on my own <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3M3Z8LL\">M4 Mac mini</a>server?</p><p>If this intro just gave you whiplash, imagine my reaction when I first started playing around with <a href=\"https://clawd.bot/\">Clawdbot</a>, the incredible <a href=\"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot\">open-source project</a> by <a href=\"https://steipete.me/\">Peter Steinberger</a> (a name that should be <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-10-3-beta-re-introduces-warning-for-old-32-bit-apps-suggests-future-incompatibility/\">familiar to longtime MacStories readers</a>) that&#8217;s become <em>very</em>popular in certain AI communities over the past few weeks. I kept seeing Clawdbot being mentioned by people I follow; eventually, I gave in to peer pressure, followed the instructions provided by the funny crustacean mascot on the app&#8217;s <a href=\"https://docs.clawd.bot/start/getting-started\">website</a>, installed Clawdbot on my new M4 Mac mini (which is not my main production machine), and <a href=\"https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/telegram\">connected it to Telegram</a>.</p><p>To say that Clawdbot has fundamentally altered my perspective of what it means to have an intelligent, personal AI assistant in 2026 would be an understatement.</p></blockquote><p>The catch is that agents like OpenClaw are built on a foundation of LLMs, and as we well know, LLMs hallucinate and make all kinds of hard to predict and sometimes hard to detect errors. AutoGPT had a tendency to report that it had completed tasks that it hadn&#8217;t really, and we can expect OpenClaw to do the same. (I have already heard some reports of various stupid errors it makes).</p><p>But what I am most worried about is security and privacy. As the security researcher Nathan Hamiel put it to me in a text this morning, half-joking, moltbot, is &#8220;basically just AutoGPT with more access and worse consequences.&#8221; (By more access what he means is that OpenClaw is being given access to user passwords, databases, etc, essentially everything on your system).</p><p>One of the big issues, which Hamiel and I wrote about here in August  (pre OpenClaw, but in the context of AI agents writing and debugging code) is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT\">prompt injection attacks</a>, in which stray bit of texts can have nasty consequences. In essay called <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/garymarcus/p/llms-coding-agents-security-nightmare?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web\">LLMs + Coding Agents = Security Nightmare</a>, we talked about how LLMs, which mimic human text (and even human-written code) but understand what that they produce only superficially, can easily be tricked. We talked for instance about how an &#8220;attacker could hide malicious prompts in white text on a white background, unnoticed by humans but noticed by the LLM&#8221;, using the malicious prompts to seize control of the users machines.  </p><p>OpenClaw inherits all these weaknesses. In Hamiel&#8217;s words (in an email this morning), &#8220;these systems are operating as \"you.&#8221; &#8230; they operate above the security protections provided by the operating system and the browser. This means application isolation and same-origin policy don\\'t apply to them.&#8221; Truly a recipe for disaster. Where Apple iPhone applications are carefully sandboxed and appropriately isolated to minimize harm, OpenClaw is basically a weaponized aerosol, in prime position to <a href=\"https://www.fastslang.com/fuck-shit-up\">fuck shit up</a>, if left unfettered. </p><p>&#167;</p><p>That brings me to Molt<em>book</em>, which is one of the wildest experiments in AI history.

Imagine it is the early 1980s and you need to communicate with people across the country. A first-class letter <a href=\"https://gbps.org.uk/information/rates/inland/letters-1968-2006.php\">will cost you 17p</a> - about 60p in <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator\">today\\'s money</a>. The letter will be delivered the next day and you\\'ll have your answer back the day after.</p>\\n\\n<p>By contrast, a single computer terminal was likely to set you back <a href=\"https://nosher.net/archives/computers/adve_045\">around £3,000</a> - and that\\'s before you take into account message transmission costs. That\\'s roughly the same price as sending over 8,000 letters.  Is that a sensible investment for the 1980\\'s businessman?</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1986, British Telecom started producing \"The Communications Programme\" which was \"a new video magazine produced exclusively for the top communications people in the UK\\'s largest organisations\".</p>\\n\\n<p>The show was distributed on video-tape and the <a href=\"https://btarchives.access.preservica.com/?s=&amp;hh_cmis_filter=calm.CalmSeries%2FThe+Communications+Programme&amp;saved_filters=calm.CalmSeries%2FThe+Communications+Programme\">archived shows</a> are genuinely fascinating. They\\'re a mixture of business reporting, thinly veiled advertorials, and a glance at the future of digital services.</p>\\n\\n<p>Buried in the middle of <a href=\"https://btarchives.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_674807ef-9ac1-4658-a6e8-86691a797d8b/\">episode 4</a> is this advert from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>\\n\\n<video controls=\"\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vanguard.mp4\">\\n  \\n</video>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s very little online information about the \"Vanguard Project\" - it was a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0268-4012(88)90017-5\">VADS initiative</a> (Value Added Data Services) run by DTI, BT, IBM, INS, ISTEL, and FASTRAK. Some of those acronyms survive, some don\\'t!</p>\\n\\n<p>Its aim was to promote awareness of EDI and its potential for the United Kingdom.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>In 1986 the Department of Trade and Industry launched a project called Vanguard to promote the development of this kind of service in 10 different sectors including construction, educational supplies and wholesale food distribution. The major VADS suppliers (BT, IBM, INS, Istel and the Midland Bank) in the UK were heavily involved in the project from the beginning.</p>\\n\\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Information_Sources_in_Information_Techn/0hYjAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Information Sources in Information Technology</a></cite></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>What\\'s \"EDI\"?</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Electronic Data Interchange.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/0973a70e-db1b-4fed-b84b-931aa86602cc/content\">A means of transferring data between co-operating enterprises without having to print it out on one computer and key it into another. Requires agreement about standards (proprietary or otherwise).</a></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Did it work? Well, that\\'s hard to say!</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s a paper from 1989 called <a href=\"https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/d218650c-f50f-4627-aff7-3cf9141ee2bb/content\">Survey of Electronic Data Interchange Users and Service Providers in the UK</a>. It dives into the then current challenges of getting British businesses to adopt EDI.</p>\\n\\n<p>It quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey-Jones\">Sir John Harvey-Jones</a> saying that most people running companies were:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>…old people like me not familiar with the technological possibilities! We have great difficulty in making imaginative jumps to see the way in which the whole of our business can be reorganised, revitalised, set up in totally new ways, releasing energy and cost and putting us into the pole position. I can see abundant evidence that the full benefits of EDI will only be reaped by the companies where the Chief Executives is seized with enthusiasm for the potential prize he can grasp.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Which still seems true today! Although over-enthusiasm has led us to a weird AI-in-everything future.</p>\\n\\n<p>The paper doesn\\'t talk about Vanguard specifically, although it does have this rather cute diagram adapted from one of its reports:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"Vague graph showing how adopting technologies is beneficial.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63127\" height=\"1638\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Vanguard.webp\" width=\"2048\" />\\n\\n<p>Not quite the Gartner Hype Cycle!</p>\\n\\n<p>The paper concludes that:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately the zealots of EDI tend to be unable to ‘sell’ the benefits to management in most companies, and this is not helped by the way that many companies have been forced to trade electronically. Management tends to think that EDI is about computers, and because they think that computers are technical they abdicate responsibility with the cry of ‘its all too difficult’. This must be wrong. It is up to those who understand EDI to learn how to talk to management, and it is up to management to understand that not only is EDI not about technology, but even if it was it is still their responsibility.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Again, true as it ever was!</p>\\n\\n<p>Nestled in the bibliography is this tantalising list of publications from the now-defunct Her Majesty\\'s Stationery Office:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"List of books.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63128\" height=\"1346\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bibliography.webp\" width=\"1800\" />\\n\\n<p>None of which appear to be online, although <a href=\"https://bll01.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma990071197720109251&amp;context=L&amp;vid=44BL_INST:BLL01&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=BL_Available&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=BL_Available&amp;query=any,contains,0115139958&amp;sortby=title&amp;facet=frbrgroupid,include,9020552068280143198&amp;offset=0\">a few are in The British Library</a> - and a few more <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Value_added_and_Data_Services_Interworki/poEfAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=vanguard&amp;dq=The%20Use%20of%20VADS%20for%20the%20Aero%20Industry&amp;printsec=frontcover\">available on Google Books</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The state <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1988-03-31/debates/b4a366bd-f3c1-4855-8cc0-09ff0d1f590b/ConsultancyContracts\">awarded several contracts for Vanguard</a> - most of which seemed to be in the training space. Here\\'s what <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/edihandbooktradi0000unse\">The EDI handbook said about it</a>:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"To get the awareness-raising activity of VANGUARD off to a quick start, an offer of up to two days of free consultancy in the basic issues surrounding value added and data services was made to chairmen and managing directors in 10,000 medium sized companies. Some 2,000 responses were received expressing interest in learning more about VANGUARD and over 800 consultancy sessions have so far been taken up with leading technology consultants  Langton, Logic, Coopers S. Lybrand, PACITL, Peat Marwick Mitchell, CAP and Scicon. All of the consultants conducting these sessions have themselves passed through a two day training course organised for VANGUARD and conveying the message that value added and data services could have significant economic and strategic benefits for those firms. Later this year, beginning in June in the South West and then moving around the country, there will be a series of VANGUARD conferences, workshops and seminars, designed to offer senior management and also lower tiers of management an opportunity to hear about value added and data services from existing users and from experts on the economics and mechanics of getting started in their use. All advice offered under the VANGUARD initiative is intended to be impartial. However, it is to be hoped that suppliers of value added and data services will sieze the opportunity created by VANGUARD through its awareness raising activity to increase, in parallel, their own awareness and promotional efforts to help potential users become more familiar with their offerings. \" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63428\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vanguard.webp\" width=\"760\" />\\n\\n<p>(My thanks to <a href=\"https://mas.to/@guardeddon/115134134399462585\">Don Thompson</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/owenboswarva.bsky.social/post/3lxu4kxdvek2a\">Owen Boswarva</a>, and <a href=\"https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/User:Ms7821\">Ms7821</a> for digging out some of those references.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Did it work? By the time I entered the workforce in the 1990s, it seemed like every desk had a computer. Although the Internet was in its infancy, email and electronic ordering was a normal part of business. The various proto-Internet protocols were still around, but were quickly being replaced.</p>\\n\\n<p>A thesis published in 1991 asked an important question:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>why should a non-interventionist Government as Thatchers become directly involved in developing the market and working together with private companies whose normal aim is to increase market share at the expense of their competitors rather, than cooperate with them?</p>\\n\\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://doras.dcu.ie/19498/1/Michael_Giblin_20130729115356.pdf\">The impact of Electronic data interchange on Irish foreign trade and transport</a></cite></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law\">Metcalfe\\'s Law</a> tells us that there is no value being the only business on a network. It simply isn\\'t rational to invest in connecting to a data service that no-one else is on. But the value of that network increases as more people and businesses get connected. If you\\'ve read <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/book-review-the-entrepreneurial-state/\">The Entrepreneurial State</a>, you\\'ll know that governments are often responsible for subsidising technological initiatives like this.  The state, its citizenry, and its businesses all benefit from the increased efficiencies of electronic communications, so it is only right that the state should bootstrap these sorts of projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>I sent an <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/historical_documents_relating_to\">FoI request to find out more</a> but it looks like all the information is now archived.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you know of any other sources of information about Project Vanguard - please leave a comment.</p>'}",

Depending on the use-case, reviewing each command the agent wants to\\nrun can get tedious and time-consuming very quickly.

Skills are markdown files that instruct Claude to do\\ncertain steps in certain situations.</p>\\n<p>I created <code>.claude/skills/create-microvm/SKILL.md</code> as follows:</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-markdown\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>---\\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>name: create-microvm\\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>description: Creates a new microvm Virtual Machine on midna for running Claude in, with source code repositories and build dependencies available inside the microvm.

Afterwards, Claude reports back with:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The dcsvm microvm has been set up successfully. Here&rsquo;s what was created:</p>\\n<p>Configuration:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/home/michael/machines/midna/microvms/dcs.nix - Project-specific packages (Go toolchain, protobuf tools, uglify-js, yuicompressor,\\nzopfli)</li>\\n<li>Updated /home/michael/machines/midna/microvm.nix to include dcsvm with:\\n<ul>\\n<li>IP: 192.168.83.8</li>\\n<li>tapId: microvm6</li>\\n<li>mac: 02:00:00:00:00:07</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Workspace:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/ - Workspace directory</li>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/ssh-host-keys/ - SSH host keys (ed25519)</li>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/dcs/ - Cloned repository from <a href=\"https://github.com/Debian/dcs\">https://github.com/Debian/dcs</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Build verified - The configuration builds successfully.</p>\\n<p>To start the microvm after deploying:\\n<code>systemctl start microvm@dcsvm</code></p>\\n<p>To SSH into it:\\n<code>ssh michael@192.168.83.8</code></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Wonderful! In my experience, Claude always got the VM creation correct.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"replicating-this-setup-with-claude-code\">Replicating this setup with Claude Code</h2>\\n<p>In fact, you can go one step further: Instead of just asking Claude to create\\nnew MicroVMs, you can also ask Claude to replicate this entire setup into your\\nNixOS configuration!</p>\\n<p>Try a prompt like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>read\\n<a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/\">https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/</a>\\n— I want the exact same setup in my midna NixOS configuration please!</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>NixOS has a reputation of being hard to adopt, but once you are using NixOS, you\\ncan do powerful things like spinning up ephemeral MicroVMs for a new project\\nwithin minutes.</p>\\n<p>The maintenance effort is minimal: When I update my personal PC, my MicroVM\\nconfigurations start using the new software versions, too. Customization is easy\\nif needed.</p>\\n<p>This actually mirrors my experience with Coding Agents: I don’t feel like\\nthey’re <em>automatically</em> making existing tasks more efficient, I feel that they\\nmake things possible that were previously out of reach (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\">Jevons\\nparadox</a>).</p>\\n<p>It was fascinating (and scary!) to experience the quality increase of Coding\\nAgents during 2025. At the beginning of 2025 I thought that LLMs are an\\noverhyped toy, and felt it was almost insulting when people showed me text or\\ncode produced by these models. But almost every new frontier model release got\\nsignificantly better, and by now I have been positively surprised by Claude\\nCode’s capabilities and quality many times. It has produced code that handles\\nlegitimate edge cases I would not have considered.</p>\\n<p>With this article, I showed one possible way to run Coding Agents safely (or any\\nworkload that shouldn’t access your private data, really) that you can adjust in\\nmany ways for your needs.</p>'}",

A cherished blade sharpened on a whetstone every few months.</p>\\n<p>At the other end, we have manufacturing: just toss the dull knife into the smelter at one end of a factory, and out the other end comes a beautiful, perfect, factory-sharp replacement.</p>\\n<p>The former garners respect. And it\\'s easy to see why: frequent maintenance was requisite for civilization until the Industrial Revolution. When a suit of armor took months of skilled labor to produce, you\\'d better maintain it well.</p>\\n<p>So our culture developed in a world where maintenance has a quasi-moral component and is nearly synonymous with virtue.</p>\\n<p>My own aesthetic preference is the opposite. Maintenance is tedium. It\\'s using up valuable mental real estate perpetually juggling the upkeep status of all the objects in my life.</p>\\n<p>The modal reaction to this preference is mild revulsion. Our culture has inculcated in us the morality of thrifty maintenance.</p>\\n<p>I propose the opposite: the amount of precious time and effort spent on maintenance is a disgusting waste of human potential.</p>\\n<p>We should view the need for maintenance as a historical burden to be shrugged off, just as we\\'ve shrugged off the need for most people to participate in back-breaking agriculture.</p>\\n<p>The most common reason people give for preferring maintenance over manufacturing is <em>wastefulness</em>. Re-forging a knife is <em>wasteful</em>. But what\\'s being wasted?</p>\\n<p>The metal is not destroyed or transmuted into some lesser element. The only \"waste\" is the energy needed to melt my dull knife and cast it into a new, sharp one. In our industrial age, this is only a few <em>cents\\'</em> worth of energy.</p>\\n<p>And in our industrial age, the cheapest energy is bountiful, clean solar.</p>\\n<p>Rather than spending 10 minutes sharpening a knife on a whetstone, you\\'d be better off spending 10 minutes making solar panels, and then using those solar panels to melt and reforge your old knife.</p>\\n<p>A market economy, of course, intermediates all this, but the thought experiment is still a useful way to show how our inherited intuitions on alleged wastefulness are wrong.</p>\\n<p>There are more benefits to manufacturing as maintenance.</p>\\n<p><strong>Rebirth is a cleansing fire. Rebirth is a chance to start anew. With continual re-making, we get better at making.</strong></p>\\n<p>How much better would home construction be if we rebuilt every 10 years instead of every 50?</p>\\n<p>We\\'d have 5x the societal experience. Every homebuilder could be a master of his craft in 5 years instead of 25.</p>\\n<p>Homes would never be long out of date. No knob-and-tube wiring to contend with. No lead pipes. A home built in the 2000s would have Ethernet cable running throughout. And one in the 2010s would have a WiFi mesh in the walls.</p>\\n<p>Homes would transform to grow with families. A starter home in your 20s. A home for kids in your 30s, and a different one for teens in your 40s. Then another for empty-nesters in their 50s.</p>\\n<p>We\\'d build them much faster and cheaper. What shortcuts and simplifications can you make if you know you\\'ll tear it down 10 years later? How would society change when a home costs only a few months\\' salary, and could be built in a month?</p>\\n<p><strong>We are headed this way</strong>.</p>\\n<p>People increasingly don\\'t maintain modular desktop computers whose parts can be upgraded piecemeal. They buy a brand new maintenance-free laptop every 5 years.</p>\\n<p>Electric cars, too, require very little maintenance, and aren\\'t likely to join the ranks of classic cars people lovingly maintain for a half-century.</p>\\n<p>Homes, too, will be swept up in this.</p>\\n<p>Industrial production of homes has existed for decades, but only at the low end: manufactured mobile homes designed for trailer parks or rural plots.</p>\\n<p>But a few startups are succeeding at industrial production of homes. <a href=\"https://buildcover.com/\">Cover</a>, for example, builds luxury homes in record time.</p>\\n<p>Even without producing components in a factory like <em>Cover</em>, technologies such as humanoid robotics would get us there anyway. Imagine a squad of fifty humanoid robots descending on a homebuilding site, working 24/7 with inhumanly perfect coordination and plan-adherence. They\\'d finish in days.</p>\\n<p><strong>I\\'m reminded of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Shrine\">Ise Jingū</a></strong>, a Shintō shrine that is ceremonially rebuilt every 20 years.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s a manifestation of the concept of <em>tokowaka</em> (常若). The word literally means \"ever-young\". It\\'s the idea that vitality is preserved with periodic renewal.</p>\\n<p>The direction of industrial society is toward ubiquitous <em>tokowaka</em>. We should throw off our fetishization of maintenance and actively work towards this.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>A quick postscript on pollution:</strong> modern chemistry has enabled the creation of materials that are not readily renewed with energy alone.</p>\\n<p>Such products are popular in large part because they are so low-maintenance, but that chemical durability results in pollution.</p>\\n<p>By embracing manufacturing-as-maintenance of products made of recyclable materials like metal and wood, we can draw people away from such polluting materials.</p>'}",

The American Housing Company is a new, vertically integrated housing startup that plans to design, build, and sell or rent modular homes aimed specifically at families. There&#8217;s a few interesting things about their approach: they&#8217;re acting as both the builder and the developer, instead of trying to sell their homes to existing developers. And they&#8217;re using Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), something I&#8217;ve always thought of as an underrated building technology.

We have midwives for births, should we have \"deathwives\" for the other end of our lives? I think this book was recommended to me in the depths of the pandemic. I was too much of a chicken to read it while those around me were dying. The book aims to normalise the process of death and mostly succeeds. Unlike a lot of books, it doesn\\'t just identify a problem - it provides pages of solutions. Every chapter ends with a series of questions to ask yourself (or your loved ones) about death.</p>\\n\\n<p>At times, it is utterly heartbreaking and more than a little gruesome. Death is emotionally <em>and</em> physically distressing. Similarly, there are several stories which deal with the reality of assisted dying. I <em>think</em> the author comes down against euthanasia - but it certainly helps raise questions of whether repeatedly offering the option amounts to pressuring them into an unwanted decision.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is a <em>bit</em> homespun and cloying. I felt like it painted quite a rosy picture of what death can look like. All the nurses are angels and the doctors have endless patience, there\\'s always time for a cuppa and deathbed revelations are never awkward.</p>\\n\\n<p>Oh, and there\\'s a lovely aside about <a href=\"https://openbenches.org/\">memorial benches</a> being harbingers of doom, which I found quite amusing!</p>\\n\\n<p>This will probably sit unread on your ebook for far too long - but it is worth cracking it open and thinking about the questions it raises.</p>'}",

    "summary": "In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just \"the process of writing software\", I believe) with the term \"Automatic Programming\".\n<br />\n<br />In case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.\n<br />\n<br />Please, stop saying \"Claude vibe coded this software for me\". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.\n<br />\n<br />When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.\n<br />\n<br />That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.\n<br />\n<br />I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.\n<br />\n<br />Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).\n<a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/159\">Comments</a>",

The big moment where everything crystallizes into meaning. We accumulate these peaks in our imagination, and then arrange them into a montage that proves our existence mattered, and that we really <em>lived</em>.</p><p>Then we spend the actual substance of our lives doing laundry and feeling crappy about it...</p><p>A few years ago, I saw Douglas Coupland (author of Microserfs and Generation X, and one of my personal favorite writers) on a panel at the Sydney Writers&apos; Festival. One of the other panelists - an influencer with a recently published quasi-self-help memoir - delivered a long, dreamy anecdote about finding the true meaning of life while watching butterflies drift over a waterfall in some far-flung locale. </p><p>When she finished, the moderator asked Coupland what he thought. </p><p>He said butterflies and waterfalls are all well and good, but they&apos;re not real life. They&apos;re a flash in the pan - a spike of adrenaline and dopamine. And if you can only find meaning in those brief, luminous moments, you&apos;re in for a world of trouble.</p><p>Put it another way:</p><p>If you work a standard career from twenty-five to sixty-five, you&apos;ll experience roughly 2,080 Mondays. That&apos;s 2,080 alarm clocks set against your biological preferences and 2,080 inbox avalanches, plus 2,080 instances of navigating traffic or public transit while still metabolically processing the weekend. Add in the Tuesdays through Fridays, and you&apos;re looking at roughly 10,400 ordinary workdays across a career. Meanwhile, if you&apos;re fortunate enough to take two weeks of vacation annually for forty years, you&apos;ll accumulate 560 vacation days. The ratio is roughly 19:1 in favor of the mundane.</p><p>So we get to a question worth sitting with: </p><p><em>Do you actually like your average Monday?</em></p><h2 id=\"the-peak-experience-fallacy\">The peak experience fallacy</h2><p>Abraham Maslow spent decades studying what he called &quot;peak experiences,&quot; those episodes of ecstasy and transcendence that seemed to characterize the healthiest human specimens. His 1964 work on self-actualization celebrated these episodes as evidence of psychological flourishing, and the positive psychology movement that followed made peak experience cultivation into something approaching a secular religion. </p><p>(And don&apos;t we love a good secular religion.) </p><p>But in Maslow&apos;s research he deliberately selected subjects he considered &quot;self-actualizing&quot; and then studied what made them tick. The peak experiences he documented were symptoms of people who&apos;d already figured out something more fundamental.</p><p>What Maslow&apos;s self-actualizers actually had in common was what he would later come to call &quot;plateau living,&quot; a sustained capacity to appreciate ordinary existence, to find the sacred in the quotidian. The peaks were outgrowths of the plateaus, not replacements for them.</p><p>Somehow, this part of the research didn&apos;t make it onto the Instagram motivation accounts.</p><p>Romanticism in the nineteenth century made the extraordinary moment into a spiritual imperative. Wordsworth&apos;s &quot;spots of time,&quot; the vivid memories that restore the imagination, became cultural programming. We inherited the assumption that <em>meaning</em> lives in the exceptional rather than the everyday // that the proof of a life well-lived is a collection of dramatic set pieces.</p><h2 id=\"the-tolerated-life-problem\">The tolerated life problem</h2><p>The psychologist Philip Zimbardo has a framework called &quot;time perspective theory.&quot; People differ in how much mental weight they assign to past, present, and future. Future-oriented people tend to achieve more by conventional metrics, but they also exhibit a consistent pattern of sacrificing present satisfaction for hypothetical future rewards. When researchers follow these people over time, they find that the anticipated future keeps receding and the scaffolding remains permanent.</p><p>Seneca diagnosed this exact pathology in first-century Rome. He observed that people guard their property vigilantly but waste their time freely, treating it as an infinite resource. &quot;You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>The barely tolerated Monday is a down payment on a life that never arrives, a perpetual advance payment for goods that don&apos;t ship.</p><p>Neuroplasticity works both ways. Every Monday you survive without presence, you&apos;re training your nervous system that survival is the appropriate response to ordinary life. The brain gets efficient at what it practices, and if it practices endurance, endurance becomes its resting state. You build tolerance in the drug addiction sense: you need more and more peak moments to feel alive because your baseline has been chemically optimized for numbness.</p><h2 id=\"the-architecture-of-an-ordinary-day\">The architecture of an ordinary day</h2><p>If your life is going to be 80% Mondays and their equivalents, the design specifications for Monday matter more than the design specifications for your vacation.</p><p>The three levers that actually move the needle on everyday experience are pretty much consistent: environment, commitments, body, and the way they interact.</p><p>The concrete physical and social circumstances of ordinary days are what matter.</p><p><strong>Environment</strong> shapes behavior more powerfully than willpower. Kurt Lewin, the father of social psychology, called this &quot;field theory&quot; - behavior is a function of the person and their environment simultaneously. The architectural critic Christopher Alexander spent decades documenting how physical spaces create what he called &quot;quality without a name,&quot; that feeling of aliveness and coherence that certain places generate. Your Monday morning unfolds in a specific physical context. If that context is cluttered and friction-laden, you&apos;re fighting your suroundings before you fight your inbox.</p><p>The writer Annie Dillard, in &quot;The Writing Life:&quot;</p><blockquote>&quot;How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.&quot;</blockquote><p>She was talking specifically of the desk, the chair, the window, and the ritual of beginning. The container shapes the contents.</p><p><strong>Commitments</strong> function as architecture too, but for time rather than space. Every standing meeting and every obligation you&apos;ve accumulated is making claims on your Mondays whether you consciously choose it or not. The philosopher Harry Frankfurt distinguished between first-order desires (wanting something) and second-order desires (wanting to want something). Most people have a massive gap between what they&apos;d choose if starting fresh and what they&apos;ve accumulated through drift. Your calendar is probably full of first-order commitments that violate your second-order preferences for how you want to live.</p><p>The economist Albert Hirschman noted that people respond to deterorating situations through exit, through voice, through loyalty, or through some combination of these. Most people default to loyalty with their commitments, enduring obligations that no longer serve them because the activation energy for exit feels too high. But the asymmetry is real: the cost of one difficult conversation is finite, while the cost of tolerating an energy-draining commitment is infinite in the sense that it compounds for as long as you carry it.</p><p><strong>Body</strong> is the substrate everything else runs on, but it&apos;s the lever people most consistently ignore when designing their days. You&apos;re not a brain piloting a meat vehicle but a single integrated system, and the state of the body on Monday morning is the state of you on Monday morning. The research on sleep and movement is tediously consistent: the basics matter more than the optimizations. No biohacking compensates for six hours of sleep and a pastry for breakfast. The Monday you experience is manufactured in the preceding twenty-four hours.</p><h2 id=\"the-monday-blueprint\">The Monday blueprint</h2><p>Given all this, what would it look like to actually take Monday seriously as a design problem?</p><p>The first hour matters disproportionately. What you do between waking and starting work is the foundation that everything else builds on. If that first hour is wasted in ractive scrolling and rushed caffeine, you&apos;ve primed your nervous system for a day of low-grade stress. If it&apos;s spent in intentional movement and even ten minutes of something that feels like choice rather than obligation, you&apos;ve shifted the baseline entirely.</p><p>Most people&apos;s work blocks are structurally hostile to focus. Cal Newport has beaten the drum on deep work for years now, and the data supports him: the average knowledge worker can&apos;t go more than a few minutes without context-switching, and every switch carries cognitive costs. Your Monday needs a protected window, two hours minimum, where the work that actually matters happens without interruption; it needs the satisfaction that comes from making measurable progress on something that matters to you.</p><p>The body work is unglamorous: thirty minutes of movement and food that doesn&apos;t spike your blood sugar. Some kind of break from the sedntary. This is maintenance more than optimization, and treating it as optional is how you get to Friday afternoon feeling like you&apos;ve been through the Somme.</p><p>Lastly: relationships. </p><p>One genuine human connection per Monday and one conversation that goes beyond the transactional changes the texture of the entire day.</p><p>The longitudinal research on wellbeing, from the Harvard Study of Adult Development running since 1938 to more recent epidemiological work, keeps landing on the same finding: the quality of human relationships is the single strongest predictor of flourishing. </p><p>...And that&apos;s about it. </p><p>It&apos;s not prescriptive. </p><p>There are no lifehacks. </p><p>But the blueprint works. </p><h2 id=\"building-identity-through-iteration\">Building identity through iteration</h2><p>Virtue is a practice, not a possession. You become what you repeatedly do, which means your Mondays are literally building the person you&apos;re becoming. Every Monday you survive is training you to be a survivor, and every Monday you engage with is training you to be someone who engages.</p><p>James Clear has popularized the notion of identity-based habits: rather than focusing on outcomes, focus on becoming the type of person who naturally produces those outcomes. Applied to Monday, the question shifts from &quot;How do I get through this day?&quot; to &quot;Who is the person I&apos;m becoming through how I spend this day?&quot; The first question optimizes for survival while the second optimizes for construction.</p><p>Your life is made of ordinary days, and if those ordinary days are spent waiting for something better, you&apos;ve wished away your existence.</p><p>The goal isn&apos;t a life with more peak moments. I think that&apos;s a false and ever-elusve pursuit. The goal is a life whose default setting doesn&apos;t require escape. Your future is made of boring days done on purpose, and a life you need a vacation from is a design problem rather than a motivation problem.</p><p>The most honest mirror you own is your calendar, and if you looked at your calendar for the last month without knowing whose it was, would you want that person&apos;s life?</p><p>In Louis Malle&apos;s 1981 film My Dinner with Andre, two old friends sit in a Manhattan restaurant and talk for two hours. And yes, that&apos;s the entire movie. And yes, it&apos;s one of the best films I&apos;ve ever seen.</p><p>Andre Gregory, the theater director, has returned from years of seeking transcendence through increasingly elaborate experiences: working with Grotowski in Poland, being buried alive in a forest on Halloween, traveling to the Sahara, and participating in rituals designed to shatter ordinary consciousness. He describes these adventures with genuine wonder, convinced that modern life has anesthetized us and that only extreme experience can wake us up.</p><p>Wallace Shawn listens, fascinated but increasingly skeptical, and then he pushes back. Why, he asks, is it necessary to go to Mount Everest or get buried alive to appreciate existence? Why can&apos;t the awareness Andre found in a Polish forest be found right here, having a cup of coffee? &quot;I think if you could become fully aware of what existed in the cigar store next door to this restaurant,&quot; Shawn says, &quot;it would blow your head off.&quot;</p><p>This is The Work&#x2122;&#xfe0f;: learning to be fully present in a cigar store rather than accumulating butterflies and waterfalls or optimizing for the highlight reel. The transcendence Andre chased across continents was always available in the texture of an ordinary afternoon, an ordinary Monday. He couldn&apos;t access it because he believed that meaning lives in the hard-to-pin-down &quot;elsewhere.&quot;</p><p>Your Mondays are not obstacles between you and your real life. </p><p>They are your real life, and all that remains is whether you&apos;re awake for them.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml', 'value': '<p>Two days ago, the Anthropic Fellows program released a paper called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20245\"><em>How AI Impacts Skill Formation</em></a>. Like <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/your-brain-on-chatgpt\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning\">papers</a> on AI before it, this one is being <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1qqy2ro/anthropic_ai_assisted_coding_doesnt_show/\">treated</a> as proof that AI makes you slower and dumber. Does it prove that?</p>\\n<p>The structure of the paper is sort of similar to the 2025 MIT study <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872\"><em>Your Brain on ChatGPT</em></a>. They got a group of people to perform a cognitive task that required learning a new skill: in this case, the Python Trio library. Half of those people were required to use AI and half were forbidden from using it. The researchers then quizzed those people to see how much information they retained about Trio.</p>\\n<p>The banner result was that <strong>AI users did not complete the task faster, but performed much worse on the quiz</strong>. If you were so inclined, you could naturally conclude that any perceived AI speedup is illusory, and the people who are using AI tooling are cooking their brains. But I don’t think that conclusion is reasonable.</p>\\n<h3>Retyping AI-generated code</h3>\\n<p>To see why, let’s look at Figure 13 from the paper:</p>\\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/static/1deb94af67210428f7358afe10795555/f238d/fig13.png\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: block;\" target=\"_blank\">\\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"display: block;\"></span>\\n  <img alt=\"figure 13\" class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/static/1deb94af67210428f7358afe10795555/fcda8/fig13.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"figure 13\" />\\n  </a>\\n    </span></p>\\n<p>The researchers noticed half of the AI-using cohort spent most of their time <em>literally retyping the AI-generated code</em> into their solution, instead of copy-pasting or “manual coding”: writing their code from scratch with light AI guidance. <strong>If you ignore the people who spent most of their time retyping, the AI-users were 25% faster.</strong></p>\\n<p>I confess that this kind of baffles me. What kind of person manually retypes AI-generated code? Did they not know how to copy and paste (unlikely, since the study was mostly composed of professional or hobby developers<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-1\">1</a></sup>)? It certainly didn’t help them on the quiz score. The retypers got the same (low) scores as the pure copy-pasters.</p>\\n<p>In any case, if you know how to copy-paste or use an AI agent, I wouldn’t use this paper as evidence that AI will not be able to speed you up. </p>\\n<h3>What about the quiz scores?</h3>\\n<p>Even if AI use offers a 25% speedup, is that worth sacrificing the opportunity to learn new skills? What about the quiz scores?</p>\\n<p>Well, first we should note that <strong>the AI users who used the AI for general questions but wrote all their own code did fine on the quiz</strong>. If you look at Figure 13 above, you can see that those AI users averaged maybe a point lower on the quiz - not bad, for people working 25% faster. So at least some kinds of AI use seem fine.</p>\\n<p>But of course much current AI use is not like this: if you’re using Claude Code or Copilot agent mode, you’re getting the AI to do the code writing for you. Are you losing key skills by doing that?</p>\\n<p>Well yes, of course you are. If you complete a task in ten minutes by throwing it at a LLM, you will learn much less about the codebase than if you’d spent an hour doing it by hand. I think it’s pretty silly to deny this: it’s intuitively right, and anybody who has used AI agents extensively at work can attest to it from their own experience.</p>\\n<p>Still, I have two points to make about this.</p>\\n<h4>Software engineers are paid to ship, not to learn</h4>\\n<p>First, <strong>software engineers are not paid to learn about the codebase</strong>. We are paid to deliver business value (typically by delivering working code). If AI can speed that up dramatically, avoiding it makes you worse at your job, even if you’re learning more efficiently. That’s a bit unfortunate for us - it was very nice when we could get much better at the job simply by doing it more - but that doesn’t make it false.</p>\\n<p>Other professions have been dealing with this forever. Doctors are expected to spend a lot of time in classes and professional development courses, learning how to do their job in other ways than just doing it. It may be that future software engineers will need to spend 20% of their time manually studying their codebases: not just in the course of doing some task (which could be far more quickly done by AI agents) but just to stay up-to-date enough that their skills don’t atrophy.</p>\\n<h4>Moving faster gives you more opportunities to learn</h4>\\n<p>The other point I wanted to make is that <strong>even if your learning rate is slower, moving faster means you may learn more overall</strong>. Suppose using AI meant that you learned only 75% as much as non-AI programmers from any given task. Whether you’re learning less overall depends on <em>how many more tasks you’re doing</em>. If you’re working faster, the loss of learning efficiency may be balanced out by volume.</p>\\n<p>I don’t know if this is true. I suspect there really is no substitute for painstakingly working through a codebase by hand. But the engineer who is shipping 2x as many changes is probably also learning things that the slower, manual engineer does not know. At minimum, they’ll be acquiring a greater breadth of knowledge of different subsystems, even if their depth suffers.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the point is simply that a lower learning rate does not by itself prove that less learning is happening overall.</p>\\n<h3>We need to talk about GPT-4o</h3>\\n<p>Finally, I will reluctantly point out that the model used for this task was GPT-4o (see section 4.1). I’m reluctant here because I sympathize with the AI skeptics, who are perpetually frustrated by the pro-AI response of “well, you just haven’t tried the <em>right</em> model”. In a world where new AI models are released every month or two, demanding that people always study the best model makes it functionally impossible to study AI use at all.</p>\\n<p>Still, I’m just kind of confused about why GPT-4o was chosen. This study was funded by Anthropic, who have much better models. This study was conducted <em>in 2025</em><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-2\">2</a></sup>, at least six months after the release of GPT-4o (that’s like five years in AI time). I can’t help but wonder if the AI-users cohort would have run into fewer problems with a more powerful model.</p>\\n<h3>Summary</h3>\\n<p>I don’t have any real problem with this paper. They set out to study how different patterns of AI use affect learning, and their main conclusion - that pure “just give the problem to the model” AI use means you learn a lot less - seems correct to me.</p>\\n<p>I don’t like their conclusion that AI use doesn’t speed you up, since it relies on the fact that 50% of their participants spent their time <em>literally retyping AI code</em>. I wish they’d been more explicit in the introduction that this was the case, but I don’t really blame them for the result - I’m more inclined to blame the study participants themselves, who should have known better.</p>\\n<p>Overall, I don’t think this paper provides much new ammunition to the AI skeptic. Like I said above, it doesn’t support the point that AI speedup is a mirage. And the point it does support (that AI use means you learn less) is obvious. Nobody seriously believes that typing “build me a todo app” into Claude Code means you’ll learn as much as if you built it by hand.</p>\\n<p>That said, I’d like to see more investigation into long-term patterns of AI use in tech companies. Is the slower learning rate per-task balanced out by the higher rate of task completion? Can it be replaced by carving out explicit time to study the codebase? It’s probably too early to answer these questions - strong coding agents have only been around for a handful of months - but the answers may determine what it’s like to be a software engineer for the next decade.</p>\\n<p>edit: the popular tech youtuber Theo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZINQTR6H5dI\">cited</a> this post as a source for his video on this paper. I liked Theo’s video. I don’t agree with his point about adjusting to a new setup - in my view that would also apply to the non-AI-using group - and I thought the crack about the kind of people who make syntax errors in Python was a bit uncalled-for. However, I agree that (a) the people in the study are not incentivized to spend time teaching themselves about Trio, and (b) this study does not do anywhere near as good a job at targeting real-world use as the well-known <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/impact-of-ai-study\">METR study</a>.</p>\\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\\n<hr />\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\\n<p>See Figure 17.</p>\\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-1\">↩</a>\\n</li>\\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\\n<p>I suppose the study doesn’t say that explicitly, but the Anthropic Fellows program was only launched in December 2024, and the paper was published in January 2026.</p>\\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-2\">↩</a>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>'}",

It went by many names. The\\nmost recent one is <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\">OpenClaw</a> but in the news you might\\nhave encountered it as ClawdBot or MoltBot depending on when you read about it.\\nIt is an agent connected to a communication channel of your choice that <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/3/tools/\">just\\nruns code</a>.</p>\\n<p>What you might be less familiar with is that what&#8217;s under the hood of OpenClaw\\nis a little coding agent called <a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/\">Pi</a>. And\\nPi happens to be, at this point, the coding agent that I use almost exclusively.\\nOver the last few weeks I became more and more of a shill for the little agent.\\nAfter I gave a talk on this recently, I realized that I did not actually write\\nabout Pi on this blog yet, so I feel like I might want to give some context on\\nwhy I&#8217;m obsessed with it, and how it relates to OpenClaw.</p>\\n<p>Pi is written by <a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/\">Mario Zechner</a> and unlike Peter, who\\naims for &#8220;sci-fi with a touch of madness,&#8221; <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Mario is very grounded.  Despite\\nthe differences in approach, both OpenClaw and Pi follow the same idea: LLMs are\\nreally good at writing and running code, so embrace this.  In some ways I think\\nthat&#8217;s not an accident because Peter got me and Mario hooked on this idea, and\\nagents last year.</p>\\n<h2>What is Pi?</h2>\\n<p>So Pi is a coding agent.  And there are many coding agents.  Really, I think you\\ncan pick effectively anyone off the shelf at this point and you will be able to\\nexperience what it&#8217;s like to do agentic programming.  In reviews on this blog\\nI&#8217;ve positively talked about AMP and one of the reasons I resonated so much with\\nAMP is that it really felt like it was a product built by people who got both\\naddicted to agentic programming but also had tried a few different things to see\\nwhich ones work and not just to build a fancy UI around it.</p>\\n<p>Pi is interesting to me because of two main reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>First of all, it has a tiny core. It has the shortest system prompt of any\\nagent that I&#8217;m aware of and it only has four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. </li>\\n<li>The second thing is that it makes up for its tiny core by providing an\\nextension system that also allows extensions to persist state into sessions,\\nwhich is incredibly powerful. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And a little bonus: Pi itself is written like excellent software. It doesn&#8217;t\\nflicker, it doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of memory, it doesn&#8217;t randomly break, it is\\nvery reliable and it is written by someone who takes great care of what goes\\ninto the software.</p>\\n<p>Pi also is a collection of little components that you can build your own agent\\non top.  That&#8217;s how OpenClaw is built, and that&#8217;s also how I built my own little\\nTelegram bot and how Mario built his\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/mom\">mom</a>.  If you want\\nto build your own agent, connected to something, Pi when pointed to itself and\\nmom, will conjure one up for you.</p>\\n<h2>What&#8217;s Not In Pi</h2>\\n<p>And in order to understand what&#8217;s in Pi, it&#8217;s even more important to understand\\nwhat&#8217;s not in Pi, why it&#8217;s not in Pi and more importantly: why it won&#8217;t be in\\nPi.  The most obvious omission is support for MCP.  There is no MCP support in\\nit. While you could build an extension for it, you can also do what OpenClaw\\ndoes to support MCP which is to use\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steipete/mcporter\">mcporter</a>. mcporter exposes MCP calls via\\na CLI interface or TypeScript bindings and maybe your agent can do something\\nwith it.  Or not, I don&#8217;t know :)</p>\\n<p>And this is not a lazy omission.  This is from the philosophy of how Pi works.\\nPi&#8217;s entire idea is that if you want the agent to do something that it doesn&#8217;t\\ndo yet, you don&#8217;t go and download an extension or a skill or something like\\nthis. You ask the agent to extend itself.  It celebrates the idea of code\\nwriting and running code.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that you cannot download extensions.  It is very much\\nsupported. But instead of necessarily encouraging you to download someone else&#8217;s\\nextension, you can also point your agent to an already existing extension, say\\nlike, build it like the thing you see over there, but make these changes to it\\nthat you like.</p>\\n<h2>Agents Built for Agents Building Agents</h2>\\n<p>When you look at what Pi and by extension OpenClaw are doing, there is an\\nexample of software that is malleable like clay.  And this sets certain\\nrequirements for the underlying architecture of it that are actually in many\\nways setting certain constraints on the system that really need to go into the\\ncore design.</p>\\n<p>So for instance, Pi&#8217;s underlying AI SDK is written so that a session can really\\ncontain many different messages from many different model providers. It\\nrecognizes that the portability of sessions is somewhat limited between model\\nproviders and so it doesn&#8217;t lean in too much into any model-provider-specific\\nfeature set that cannot be transferred to another.</p>\\n<p>The second is that in addition to the model messages it maintains custom\\nmessages in the session files which can be used by extensions to store state or\\nby the system itself to maintain information that either not at all is sent to\\nthe AI or only parts of it.</p>\\n<p>Because this system exists and extension state can also be persisted to disk, it\\nhas built-in hot reloading so that the agent can write code, reload, test it and\\ngo in a loop until your extension actually is functional.  It also ships with\\ndocumentation and examples that the agent itself can use to extend itself.  Even\\nbetter: sessions in Pi are trees.  You can branch and navigate within a session\\nwhich opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities such as enabling workflows\\nfor making a side-quest to fix a broken agent tool without wasting context in\\nthe main session.  After the tool is fixed, I can rewind the session back to\\nearlier and Pi summarizes what has happened on the other branch.</p>\\n<p>This all matters because for instance if you consider how MCP works, on most\\nmodel providers, tools for MCP, like any tool for the LLM, need to be loaded\\ninto the system context or the tool section thereof on session start.  That\\nmakes it very hard to impossible to fully reload what tools can do without\\ntrashing the complete cache or confusing the AI about how prior invocations work\\ndifferently.</p>\\n<h2>Tools Outside The Context</h2>\\n<p>An extension in Pi can register a tool to be available to the LLM to call and\\nevery once in a while I find this useful. For instance, despite my criticism of\\nhow Beads is implemented, I do think that giving an agent access to a to-do list\\nis a very useful thing. And I do use an agent-specific issue tracker that works\\nlocally that I had my agent build itself. And because I wanted the agent to also\\nmanage to-dos, in this particular case I decided to give it a tool rather than a\\nCLI.  It felt appropriate for the scope of the problem and it is currently the\\nonly additional tool that I&#8217;m loading into my context.</p>\\n<p>But for the most part all of what I&#8217;m adding to my agent are either skills or\\nTUI extensions to make working with the agent more enjoyable for me.  Beyond\\nslash commands, Pi extensions can render custom TUI components directly in the\\nterminal: spinners, progress bars, interactive file pickers, data tables,\\npreview panes.  The TUI is flexible enough that Mario proved you can <a href=\"https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2008702661093454039\">run Doom\\nin it</a>.  Not practical,\\nbut if you can run Doom, you can certainly build a useful dashboard or debugging\\ninterface.</p>\\n<p>I want to highlight some of my extensions to give you an idea of what&#8217;s\\npossible.  While you can use them unmodified, the whole idea really is that you\\npoint your agent to one and remix it to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/answer.ts\"><code>/answer</code></a></h3>\\n<p>I <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/17/what-is-plan-mode/\">don&#8217;t use plan mode</a>.  I encourage the agent\\nto ask questions and there&#8217;s a productive back and forth.  But I don&#8217;t like\\nstructured question dialogs that happen if you give the agent a question tool.\\nI prefer the agent&#8217;s natural prose with explanations and diagrams interspersed.</p>\\n<p>The problem: answering questions inline gets messy.  So <code>/answer</code> reads the\\nagent&#8217;s last response, extracts all the questions, and reformats them into a\\nnice input box.</p>\\n<img alt=\"The /answer extension showing a question dialog\" src=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/static/pi-answer.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/todos.ts\"><code>/todos</code></a></h3>\\n<p>Even though I criticize <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\">Beads</a> for its\\nimplementation, giving an agent a to-do list is genuinely useful.  The <code>/todos</code>\\ncommand brings up all items stored in <code>.pi/todos</code> as markdown files.  Both the\\nagent and I can manipulate them, and sessions can claim tasks to mark them as in\\nprogress.</p>\\n\\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/review.ts\"><code>/review</code></a></h3>\\n<p>As more code is written by agents, it makes little sense to throw unfinished\\nwork at humans before an agent has reviewed it first.  Because Pi sessions are\\ntrees, I can branch into a fresh review context, get findings, then bring fixes\\nback to the main session.</p>\\n<img alt=\"The /review extension showing review preset options\" src=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/static/pi-review.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" />\\n<p>The UI is modeled after Codex which provides easy to review commits, diffs,\\nuncommitted changes, or remote PRs.  The prompt pays attention to things I care\\nabout so I get the call-outs I want (eg: I ask it to call out newly added\\ndependencies.)</p>\\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/control.ts\"><code>/control</code></a></h3>\\n<p>An extension I experiment with but don&#8217;t actively use.  It lets one Pi agent send\\nprompts to another.  It is a simple multi-agent system without complex\\norchestration which is useful for experimentation.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/files.ts\"><code>/files</code></a></h3>\\n<p>Lists all files changed or referenced in the session.  You can reveal them in\\nFinder, diff in VS Code, quick-look them, or reference them in your prompt.\\n<code>shift+ctrl+r</code> quick-looks the most recently mentioned file which is handy when\\nthe agent produces a PDF.</p>\\n<p>Others have built extensions too: <a href=\"https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents\">Nico&#8217;s subagent\\nextension</a> and\\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-interactive-shell\">interactive-shell</a> which\\nlets Pi autonomously run interactive CLIs in an observable TUI overlay.</p>\\n<h2>Software Building Software</h2>\\n<p>These are all just ideas of what you can do with your agent.  The point of it\\nmostly is that none of this was written by me, it was created by the agent to my\\nspecifications.  I told Pi to make an extension and it did.  There is no MCP, there are\\nno community skills, nothing.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I use tons of skills.  But\\nthey are hand-crafted by my clanker and not downloaded from anywhere.  For\\ninstance I fully replaced all my CLIs or MCPs for browser automation with a\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/skills/web-browser/SKILL.md\">skill that just uses\\nCDP</a>.\\nNot because the alternatives don&#8217;t work, or are bad, but because this is just\\neasy and natural.  The agent maintains its own functionality.</p>\\n<p>My agent has <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/tree/main/skills\">quite a few\\nskills</a> and crucially\\nI throw skills away if I don&#8217;t need them.  I for instance gave it a skill to\\nread Pi sessions that other engineers shared, which helps with code review.  Or\\nI have a skill to help the agent craft the commit messages and commit behavior I\\nwant, and how to update changelogs.  These were originally slash commands, but\\nI&#8217;m currently migrating them to skills to see if this works equally well.  I\\nalso have a skill that hopefully helps Pi use <code>uv</code> rather than <code>pip</code>, but I also\\nadded a custom extension to intercept calls to <code>pip</code> and <code>python</code> to redirect\\nthem to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>\\n<p>Part of the fascination that working with a minimal agent like Pi gave me is\\nthat it makes you live that idea of using software that builds more software.\\nThat taken to the extreme is when you remove the UI and output and connect it\\nto your chat.  That&#8217;s what OpenClaw does and given its tremendous growth,\\nI really feel more and more that this is going to become our future in one\\nway or another.</p>\\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292\">https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292</a><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#fnref-1\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>'}",

But the abstraction ceiling is very low. If you have a bunch of almost identical rules, e.g.:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"language-makefile highlighter-rouge\">\\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nl\">a.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">a.csv plot.py</span>\\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"nl\">b.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">b.csv plot.py</span>\\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"nl\">c.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">c.csv plot.py</span>\\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>You can use pattern-matching to them into a “rule schema”, by analogy to axiom schemata:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"language-makefile highlighter-rouge\">\\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nl\">%.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">%.csv plot.py</span>\\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>Which works backwards: when something in the build graph depends on a target matching <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">%.png</code>, Make synthesizes a rule instance with a dependency on the corresponding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.csv</code> file.</p>\\n\\n<p>But pattern matching is still very limited. Lately I’ve been building my own <a href=\"https://plaintextaccounting.org/\">plain-text accounting</a> solution using some Python scripts. One of the tasks is to read a CSV of bank transactions from 2019–2024 and split it into TOML files for each year-month, to make subsequent processing parallelizable. So the rules might be something like:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code class=\"language-makefile:\">ledger/2019-08.toml: inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\\n    uv run import_from_checkbook.py --year=2019 --month=8\\n\\nledger/2019-09.toml: inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\\n    uv run import_from_checkbook.py --year=2019 --month=9\\n\\n# ...\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I had to write a Python script to generate the complete Makefile. Makefiles look like code, but are data: they are a container format for tiny fragments of shell that are run on-demand by the Make engine. And because Make doesn’t scale, for complex tasks you have to bring out a real programming language to generate the Makefile.</p>\\n\\n<p>I wish I could, instead, write a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">make.py</code> file with something like this:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\">\\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">whatever</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">BuildGraph</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"n\">EXPORT</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\"</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"c1\"># The (year, month) pairs I have bank transaction CSVs for.\\n</span><span class=\"n\">year_months</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">list</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">tuple</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2019</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2026</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">13</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"c1\"># Import transactions for each year-month into a separate ledger.\\n</span><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">month</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">year_months</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s\">\"ledger/</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">_</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">month</span><span class=\"si\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">02</span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">.toml\"</span>\\n    <span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rule</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">targets</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">deps</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">EXPORT</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\\n        <span class=\"n\">fn</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">import_from_checkbook</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">month</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>Fortunately this exists: it’s called <a href=\"https://pydoit.org/\">doit</a>, but it’s not widely known.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p>A lot of things are like Makefiles: data that should be lifted one level up to become code.</p>\\n\\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_CloudFormation\">CloudFormation</a>. Nobody likes writing those massive YAML files by hand, so AWS introduced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Cloud_Development_Kit\">CDK</a>, which is literally just a library<sup id=\"fnref:fn1\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://borretti.me/feed.xml#fn:fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> of classes that represent AWS resources. Running a CDK program emits CloudFormation YAML as though it were an assembly language for infrastructure.

Static data has better safety/static analysis properties than code, but I don’t think that’s foremost in mind when people design these systems. Besides, using code to emit data (as CDK does) gives you those exact same properties. Rather, I think some people think it’s cute and clever to build tiny DSLs in a data format.

In Minneapolis, people are using hyper-local Signal groups for their buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and schools.</p><p>If you, like me, are in a ton of newly created Signal groups full people you don&apos;t know, or just met for the first time, keeping track of who is saying what might be super confusing.</p><p>Signal has a feature called <a href=\"https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007319011-Manage-Contacts-Nicknames-and-Notes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nicknames</a> that can help. If you know that your friend Laura used to go by &quot;Mmm &#x1f32e;&quot; on Signal but recently changed her name to simply &quot;&#x1f951;&quot;, you can click on the &#x1f951; contact and set her nickname to &quot;Laura&quot; instead. From now on, you&apos;ll just see her as Laura, and your Signal groups will be slightly less confusing.</p><p>To set a nickname, go to a Signal group and click on the avatar of one of your contacts. It will pop up a menu like this:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"Is everyone in your Signal groups named something like &quot;E&quot; or &quot;&#x1F951;&quot;?

You can set the name that you want to know this person as, and you can also add a note about this contact if you want. Nicknames and notes are stored end-to-end encrypted only for you. No one else can see what nicknames you&apos;ve set.</p><p>From this point on, once you set &#x1f951;&apos;s nickname to Laura, you&apos;ll just see her as Laura. If you mention her in the chat using &quot;@Laura&quot;, others in the chat will see you posting &quot;@&#x1f951;&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s it. Now people can use whatever crazy names they want, and change them as frequently as they want, and you no longer need to be confused.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-even-necessary-infiltrators\">Why is this even necessary? Infiltrators.</h2><p>Signal is a usable, secure, encrypted messaging app. The tech is solid. That said, there are still two ways that Signal groups get compromised:</p><ul><li><strong>Someone&apos;s device gets searched.</strong> This typically happens after they get arrested, or searched at a border crossing or other security checkpoint, or their home or office is raided. See <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/practical-defenses-against-technofascism/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Practical Defenses Against Technofascism</a> for some advise on dealing with this.</li><li><strong>Or an infiltrator joins the group.</strong></li></ul><p>Infiltrators join groups with lax permissions. Or, uh, maybe <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/we-are-currently-clean-on-opsec-the-signalgate-saga/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Trump&apos;s national security advisor just adds them</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re not familiar with how Signal group links and permissions work, check out <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/using-signal-groups-for-activism/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Using Signal groups for activism</a>. Some groups have group links on and anyone with the link can join. Others might allow anyone in the group to invite anyone else.</p><p>With large groups &#x2013; a requirement for mass movements &#x2013; group permissions like these make it easy for new people to get involved. But at the same time, they also make it a lot easier for infiltrators to snake their way in.</p><p>Because of the risk of infiltrators, it&apos;s common &#x2013; and in many cases a good idea &#x2013; to not put your real name in your Signal profile.</p><p>If a single infiltrator sneaks in, they&apos;ll get access to a list of everyone in the group. It&apos;s much harder for a MAGA chud to dox and harass you, or for the government to investigate you, if they only know you as &quot;&#x1f951;&quot;, without knowing your real name.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-signup-card kg-width-regular \" style=\"background-color: #F0F0F0; display: none;\">\\n            \\n            <div class=\"kg-signup-card-content\">\\n                \\n                <div class=\"kg-signup-card-text \">\\n                    <h2 class=\"kg-signup-card-heading\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sign up for micahflee</span></h2>\\n                    <p class=\"kg-signup-card-subheading\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Hi, I&apos;m Micah.

Jobs, the chief executive of\\nApple Computer, shared an e-mail chuckle with his employees at the\\nexpense of Dell, a big rival.</p>\\n\\n<p>The message was prompted by the 12 percent surge in Apple’s stock\\nprice last week, which pushed the company’s market capitalization\\nto $72.13 billion, passing Dell’s value of $71.97 billion.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1997, shortly after Mr. Jobs returned to Apple, the company he\\nhelped start in 1976, Dell’s founder and chairman, Michael S.\\nDell, was asked at a technology conference what might be done to\\nfix Apple, then deeply troubled financially.</p>\\n\\n<p>“What would I do?” Mr. Dell said to an audience of several\\nthousand information technology managers. “I’d shut it down and\\ngive the money back to the shareholders.”</p>\\n\\n<p>On Friday, apparently savoring the moment, Mr. Jobs sent a brief\\ne-mail message to Apple employees, which read: “Team, it turned\\nout that Michael Dell wasn’t perfect at predicting the future.\\nBased on today’s stock market close, Apple is worth more than\\nDell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow,\\nbut I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today.

Blockchain analysis can often reveal information that no one intended to share.</p>\\n<p>This is true even for privacy coins like Monero and Zcash. These coins put less information directly on chain in the clear, but they still have to be <strong>used with skill</strong> to maintain privacy.

In those cases, the code allocates exactly <code>sizeof(SAFEARRAY)</code> bytes and doesn&#8217;t allocate any bonus data for the reference count.</p>\\n<p>Indeed, there three flags <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/ns-oaidl-safearray\"> in the <code>fFeatures</code> member</a> for these &#8220;bring your own <code>SAFEARRAY</code>&#8221; structures.</p>\\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"cp3\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>FADF_AUTO</code></td>\\n<td>An array that is allocated on the stack.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>FADF_STATIC</code></td>\\n<td>An array that is statically allocated.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>FADF_EMBEDDED</code></td>\\n<td>An array that is embedded in a structure.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>These flag indicate that the array was not created by <code>Safe\\xadArray\\xadCreate</code> but rather was constructed manually by the caller in various ways.¹</p>\\n<p>Note that if you pass a <code>SAFEARRAY</code> with one these flags to <code>Safe\\xadArray\\xadAdd\\xadRef</code>, it will still increment the reference count, but you don&#8217;t get a data pointer back because the caller does not control the lifetime of the <code>SAFEARRAY</code>. The lifetime of the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> is controlled by the lifetime of the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> variable on the stack (<code>FADF_AUTO</code>), in the DLL&#8217;s global data segment (<code>FADF_STATIC</code>), or in the enclosing object (<code>FADF_EMBEDDED</code>).</p>\\n<p>This means that our earlier suggestion to wrap the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> inside an in/out <code>VARIANT</code> runs into trouble if the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> is one of these types of arrays with externally-controlled lifetime. For those, you have no choice but to copy the data.</p>\\n<p>¹ The documentation is, however, ambiguous about what &#8220;the array&#8221; refers to. Is it referring to the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> structure itself? Or is it referring to the data pointed to by the <code>pvData</code> member?</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260130-00/?p=112025\">Why not store the &lt;CODE&gt;SAFEARRAY&lt;/CODE&gt; reference count as a hidden allocation next to the &lt;CODE&gt;SAFEARRAY&lt;/CODE&gt;?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}",

In the center floats the disembodied head of Mark Zuckerberg\\'s metaverse avatar. It has been modified: a black bar scrawled with grawlix covers the mouth.\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/eurostack-threads.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<h1>Threads\\' margin is the Eurostack\\'s opportunity (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/30/zucksauce/#gandersauce\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p>OG App is the coolest app you\\'ve never heard of. Back in 2022, two teenagers unilaterally disenshittified Instagram by making an \"alt-client\" that restored all the parts of Insta that made it a success and blocked all the antifeatures that Meta crammed down users\\' throats after they had them locked in.</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s how OG App worked: first, it popped up a browser window and loaded the Instagram login screen. Then, after you\\'d logged into Insta, it stole the \"session key\" (the cryptographic proof that you were logged into your account). That let it impersonate you to Insta\\'s servers, and slurp down the whole feed that Insta had queued up for you.</p>\\n<p>After grabbing your feed, OG App deleted all the ads, all the slop, all the boosted content, all the months-old clickbait that The Algorithm (TM) had surfaced. What was left was pristine: the posts from people you followed, in reverse-chronological order. To make this all even sweeter, OG App sent <em>no</em> data back to Meta as you used it, except for the likes and comments you <em>intended</em> to transmit to the company. All the other data that Meta\\'s apps gather got blocked: everything from your location, to which posts you slowed down your scrolling on, to accelerometer readouts that revealed minute changes in how you hold your phone from second to second.</p>\\n<p><em>Boy</em> did people like this! By the end of the day, OG App was in the top ten charts for both Google and Apple\\'s app stores. By the next morning, it was gone. Meta sent a takedown notice to the app store duopoly and they killed OG App on its behalf (there is honor among thieves):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/\">https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/og-app-promises-you-an-ad-free-instagram-feed/</a></p>\\n<p>The funny thing is, the OG App creators were just following the Facebook playbook. When Facebook opened up to the general public in 2006, it had the problem that everyone who wanted social media already had an account on Myspace, and all of Facebook\\'s improvements on Myspace (Zuck made a promise <em>never</em> to spy on his users!) didn\\'t matter, because Myspace had something Facebook could not match: Myspace had all your friends.</p>\\n<p>Facebook came up with an ingenious solution to this problem: they offered Myspace users a bot. You gave that bot your Myspace login credentials (just as OG App did with your Insta credentials) and the bot impersonated you to Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and it grabbed everything queued up for you on Myspace (just as OG App did with Insta), and then flowed those messages into your Facebook feed (just as OG App did with Insta).</p>\\n<p>This was very successful! Users didn\\'t have to choose between their friends on Myspace and the superior design and privacy policies of Facebook. They got to eat their cake and have it, too.</p>\\n<p>This is actually a very old and important pattern in tech. It\\'s what \"move fast and break things\" looks like when it\\'s actually disrupting sclerotic and decaying companies that lock us in, take us for granted, and treat us like shit. It\\'s what Apple did when they cloned the MS Office file formats and released iWork, whose Pages, Numbers and Keynote let Microsoft users escape from the prison of Windows and bring their documents with them:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay</a></p>\\n<p>But like every pirate, the tech companies dreamed of being admirals. Once they\\'d attained the admiralty, they announced that when they did this stuff, it was progress, but if anyone does it to <em>them</em>, it would be piracy.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, they were able to take advantage of a metastasizing blob of IP laws that the US Trade Representative spread around the world (with threats of tariffs for noncompliance). Soon, nearly every country had enacted laws that made it a literal crime for their entrepreneurs and technologists to fix America\\'s defective tech exports by adding privacy tools, bridging old services into new ones, or reading and writing America\\'s ubiquitous proprietary file-formats:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition\">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition</a></p>\\n<p>For decades, this system was immovable. The world couldn\\'t afford tariffs on its exports to the USA, and it was able to maintain the pretense that America\\'s platforms were trustworthy neutral parties, that would not be weaponized against their own national interest at the behest of the American state.</p>\\n<p>Obviously, that is <em>dead</em> now. Donald Trump, debilitated by white matter disease and his endemic incontinent belligerence, has flipped the table over in a poker game that was rigged in his favor because he resented having to pretend to play (TM November Kelly):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar\">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar</a></p>\\n<p>EU member-states are minting new \"digital sovereignty\" ministries as fast as they can print up new business cards, the EU itself has just appointed its first \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/college-commissioners/henna-virkkunen_en</a></p>\\n<p>They\\'re building the \"Eurostack,\" a fleet of EU-based data centers that will host free, open, auditable, trustworthy equivalents to the US tech giants\\' offerings:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/25/eurostack/#viktor-orbans-isp\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/25/eurostack/#viktor-orbans-isp</a></p>\\n<p>But Eurostack is about to run into a wall: Article 6 of the EU\\'s own Copyright Directive, which prohibits reverse-engineering and modification of tech products. It\\'s a law that the US Trade Rep lobbied hard for, winning the day by promising tariff-free access to the US for Europe\\'s exports (a promise Trump has now broken):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/15/freedom-of-movement/#data-dieselgate</a></p>\\n<p>So long as Europe continues to hold up its end of this one-sided bargain, it will not be able to create the reverse-engineering based tools to let EU companies, governments and households get their data out of US tech silos, let alone let them build and enjoy successors to OG App, which will make it easy for them to leave US social media without sacrificing contact with the people who matter to them.</p>\\n<p>Which brings me to Threads, Meta\\'s latest social media network. Threads is built on Activitypub and Mastodon, these being open/free, auditable and trustworthy protocols, designed to support \"federated\" social media. That\\'s social media that runs on servers managed by lots of different entities, whose users can all connect to one another no matter which server they use. Meta was clearly excited by the prospect of enclosing and conquering this open upstart, but also nervous at the prospect that its users would find, in federation, an easy path to escape from Meta\\'s clutches.</p>\\n<p>After all, if you can leave Threads and join a non-Meta Mastodon server without losing contact with the people you followed and were followed by on Threads, then why wouldn\\'t you leave? Mark Zuckerberg\\'s users don\\'t like him &#8211; they just hate him less than they love the people they are in community with on Zuckerberg\\'s platforms.</p>\\n<p>So Threads never <em>really</em> joined the Fediverse. You can\\'t quite follow and be followed by Mastodon users, and you can\\'t quite migrate your account off Meta\\'s servers and onto a better one. Zuck and his lieutenants are keenly attuned to any design that drives high \"switching costs\" for leaving their services, and they exploit these switching costs to figure out just how much pain they can inflict on users without risking their departure:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs</a></p>\\n<p>So now they\\'ve started to turn the screws on Threads users. They just announced a global program of Threads enshittification, with a promise to cram ads into the eyeballs of every Threads account:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.contentgrip.com/meta-threads-ads-go-global/\">https://www.contentgrip.com/meta-threads-ads-go-global/</a></p>\\n<p>This represents a hell of an opportunity for the EU and Eurostack. Meta\\'s ads are wildly illegal in the EU, violating Europe\\'s landmark privacy law, the GDPR. The only reason Meta gets away with its flagrant lawbreaking is that it has captured the Irish state, and uses legal tricks to force all GDPR enforcement into Irish jurisdiction:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/01/erin-go-blagged/#big-tech-omerta</a></p>\\n<p>People <em>hate</em> ads. More than half of all web users have installed an adblocker (which also protects their privacy). It\\'s the largest consumer boycott in human history:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/\">https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/</a></p>\\n<p>But no one has ever installed an adblocker for an app, because reverse-engineering apps and the mobile platforms they run on is illegal under laws like Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. As a result, tech companies &#8211; especially US giants, who can violate EU law with impunity &#8211; love to enshittify their apps, because they know that no one can do unto them as they did unto their own rivals (like Myspace).</p>\\n<p>Meta\\'s new ad strategy for Threads is the perfect cue for a European repeal of Article 6 of the Copyright Directive. Procedurally, this is a great moment for it, as the EU is finalizing the Digital Fairness Act, which could include an exemption to EUCD 6 for privacy-enhancing technologies:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-protecting-our-democracy-upholding-our-values/file-digital-fairness-act\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-protecting-our-democracy-upholding-our-values/file-digital-fairness-act</a></p>\\n<p>Giving Europeans an effective way to push back against Meta\\'s wholesale violation of their rights is a way that the Eurostack can score popular support <em>right now</em> &#8211; not in five years when the new data centers come online. It\\'s a way of improving the lives of Europeans in immediate, concrete ways, rather than asking them to be grateful that some ministry has changed cloud providers &#8211; an important change, sure, but one that has no real impact on their daily lives.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, legalizing jailbreaking for the purpose of making Threads alt-clients wouldn\\'t just give Europeans a better social media experience &#8211; it could bootstrap European social media services. Remember, Threads was able to achieve instant scale by moving Instagram users onto Threads wholesale, maintaining their Insta follows and followers when they created their Threads accounts.</p>\\n<p>Europe &#8211; like everywhere else &#8211; is full of entrepreneurs who are trying to get national, independent social media platforms off the ground, hoping to woo users by promising them a more privacy-respecting alternative. They\\'ve got the same problem Zuck had when he tried to compete with Myspace: users love their friends more than they hate being spied on, so merely offering a better service is insufficient.</p>\\n<p>To get users off the old platforms, you have to lower their switching costs &#8211; you have to let them bring their friends to the new network, even if those friends are still stuck on the old network. Legalize jailbreaking in the EU and you\\'ll make it possible to do \"on-device bridging\" &#8211; where a new social media app is able to break open the data storage of the Threads app on the same device and move that data into its own feeds. And because the EU has the GDPR, they have the privacy framework needed to police the privacy violations that breaking into other apps\\' data storage can lead to.</p>\\n<p>Meta will squawk. They\\'ll say Europe is legalizing the violation of its corporate rights. But Meta violates Europeans\\' rights at scale, and the \"rights\" that I\\'m talking about taking away from Meta are rights the EU gave it in the first place, in exchange for a broken promise of tariff-free access to the USA.</p>\\n<p>Adblocking isn\\'t stealing. Adblocking is <em>bargaining</em>. Without adblocking, the companies don\\'t sell us services in exchange for our privacy &#8211; they plunder all the private data they can get, and dribble out services at whatever level they think we deserve. If ad-supported media was a restaurant, it\\'d be one where you got thrown up against a wall, relieved of your wallet, fed a handful of gruel, and then got kicked in the ass and sent on your way:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah</a></p>\\n<p>Every time Donald Trump threatens the EU, he makes the case for the Eurostack, but still, he can\\'t help himself. Likewise, every time Zuckerberg enshittifies his services, he makes the case for repealing Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and he can\\'t help himself either.</p>\\n<p>Threads\\' inexorable enshittification is an opportunity: an opportunity to make the case for the Eurostack, an opportunity to improve the lives of millions of Europeans, and an opportunity to break through the walled gardens that keep the people we love stuck on legacy social media platforms.</p>\\n<p>When they did it to us, that wasn\\'t progress. When we do it to them, it\\'s not piracy.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a

    "summary": "<p>After watching a Veritasium video, I feel a surge of intellectual confidence. I feel smarter. Whether it's a video on lasers or quantum physics, it seems like I have a better grasp on the subject. I finally get it. Derek and his crew just have a way of simplifying complex ideas, unraveling their mysteries, and lifting your confidence as each term is explained.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Every video they release is logically sound. Almost as if I could have come to the same conclusion if I'd spent an equal amount of time as they did. Except I only spent 30 minutes watching the video. And now, whenever someone brings up quantum physics or lasers, the bells ring in my head.</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh, I know quantum physics.\"</p>\n\n<p>And then I try to explain.</p>\n\n<p>\"So it's all about uncertainty. You have the qubit, and it can be zero or one... or both. Wait no, that's quantum computers. Quantum physics is more about strings. When things are much smaller than atoms, the rules are different. And then one particle can affect another particle, even at a large distance. Even if it's on the other side of the universe. Trust me, it's very interesting. You just have to watch the video.\"</p>\n\n<p>You should watch the video indeed. The problem is that Derek understood the subject and explained it confidently. What we do is watch it passively and pick up on his confident tone. It's the illusion of understanding, an afterglow of a compelling narrative, delivered with authority. Teaching or explaining is like a reality check for our knowledge. If you want to know how well you understood a subject, try explaining it. You'll quickly differentiate your confidence from your competence.</p>\n\n<p>With YouTube videos, you at least have to watch the whole video to develop that confidence. But with ChatGPT, you just type a question, and an authoritative voice presents you with all the information you need to win an argument. This argument is usually delivered via screenshot and shared on social media as proof for whatever statement is being defended.</p>\n\n<p>LLMs have accelerated this confidence in people without necessarily improving our knowledge. For the most part, when people quote an LLM, they don't read past the part that agrees with them. It's even better when it's a Google AI overview that highlights just the part you need and can never be cited.</p>\n\n<p>The medium is the message. With LLMs, we seek answers, not knowledge. It's almost as if the time spent researching is directly proportional to the amount of information we retain. If you watch a 60-second fast-paced video that teaches cooking hacks on TikTok, it probably won't turn you into a cook. You'll be entertained though and have the confidence of a cook.</p>\n\n<p>When you ask an LLM to explain a complex subject, you can read it through and understand it in that one sitting. But you probably won't grasp it enough to apply it or explain it to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>But fear not, it's not all doom and gloom. You can learn about quantum physics from a video. First, you should try explaining it to see if you understand it. If not, you can rewatch it actively. Take notes, read more articles, immerse yourself in the subject. Turn entertainment into education by doing something with the information. Sketch it on paper, talk about it with peers interested in the subject. If you're going to use an LLM to understand, read all the material and have follow-up questions that you can revisit in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The point is to turn that initial confidence into active participation that motivates you to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>But most importantly, avoid the temptation of the medium. When you watch a fascinating lecture on YouTube, the most natural thing to do next is to watch another fascinating video on YouTube. Avoid this at all costs because there are infinite videos to watch.</p>\n\n<p>Having confidence after watching interesting content isn't a bad thing. But it should be used as motivation to dig deeper. Otherwise, it's just vanity.</p>",

    "title": "Will AI Make Package Managers Redundant?",
    "link": "https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/30/will-ai-make-package-managers-redundant.html",
    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/30/will-ai-make-package-managers-redundant.html', 'value': '<p>A <a href=\"https://medium.com/@marcelo.emmerich/the-package-manager-of-the-future-95408980478f\">recent post by Marcelo Emmerich</a> proposes replacing package managers with a “prompt registry.” Instead of publishing code, library authors would publish AI prompts. Developers paste the prompt into their AI tool, which generates a self-contained implementation on the spot. No transitive dependencies, no supply chain attacks, no version conflicts. The code is generated fresh each time, tailored to your language and project.</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s a naive vision, but it points at real problems. Supply chain attacks are serious. Transitive dependency trees are genuinely hard to reason about. The appeal of generating exactly what you need, with nothing extra, is obvious.</p>\\n\\n<p>The generated code still has to implement TLS, parse JSON, handle Unicode. The complexity doesn’t vanish because you stopped calling it a dependency; it just moves elsewhere. But I love going down a rabbit hole, so let’s see where this leads.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"down-the-rabbit-hole\">Down the rabbit hole</h3>\\n\\n<p>Suppose you’re writing the prompt for an HTTP client library. The prompt needs to describe the behavior precisely enough that the AI generates something correct. Not just the happy path. You need to specify connection pooling, redirect handling, timeout behavior, retry logic, TLS certificate verification, proxy support. Each of those has edge cases that vary across operating systems, architectures and runtime versions.</p>\\n\\n<p>So you write tests. The prompt needs to come with a test suite, or at least a prompt that generates a test suite, because otherwise you have no way to know whether the generated code actually works. Those tests need to cover the matrix of platforms and runtimes. An HTTP client that works on Linux x86 with Python 3.12 but silently drops headers on macOS ARM with Python 3.10 isn’t a working HTTP client. And the model itself is another axis in the matrix: GPT-4o might generate correct TLS handling where Claude produces a subtle bug, or vice versa, or the same model might produce different code after a provider updates it. You’d need to re-run your test suite every time a model version changes. By the time you’ve written a prompt detailed enough to specify all this behavior, plus a test generation prompt thorough enough to verify it, you’ve likely produced something larger than the library you were trying to replace.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now the prompt author improves the prompt. Maybe they add HTTP/2 support, or fix the connection pooling specification. Downstream users need to know about this. They need to choose when to adopt the new version. So you version the prompts. You need a way to say “I’m using v2.3 of the HTTP client prompt” and have that mean something stable. You’ll want a changelog. You’ll want the ability to pin to a known-good version while others test the new one.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then you notice the test cases for an HTTP client are very similar regardless of the target language. The edge cases around TLS verification don’t change just because you’re generating Python instead of Go. So you extract the shared test specifications into reusable modules. Other prompt authors want to use those modules too. Now the test spec modules need their own versions, because a change to the shared TLS test suite shouldn’t silently break the HTTP client prompt or the WebSocket prompt that also depends on it.</p>\\n\\n<p>At this point the HTTP client prompt declares that it works with v1.2 to v1.x of the TLS test module, and v2.0 or higher of the connection pooling spec module. These are dependency declarations. You need a resolver to figure out which versions of these prompt modules are compatible with each other. You need a lockfile (a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Promptfile.lock</code>, if you will) so that everyone on the team generates from the same set of prompt versions.</p>\\n\\n<p>The prompts themselves are getting long and repetitive. You find yourself writing the same patterns over and over: “handle timeouts by…”, “verify certificates by…”, “follow redirects up to N hops, preserving headers except…” You start defining shorthand. “Implements HTTP-REDIRECT-SPEC-v2” instead of spelling it out every time. Other prompt authors adopt your shorthand. Someone writes a document defining exactly what HTTP-REDIRECT-SPEC-v2 means, and now you have a specification language.</p>\\n\\n<p>The specification language gets more precise over time, because natural language is ambiguous and different models interpret the same prompt differently. You add more structure. You define exact function signatures. You specify return types. You nail down error handling behavior with enough precision that two different models should produce interchangeable output. The specification starts looking less like English prose and more like a programming language. A formal, deterministic description of behavior that a machine can reliably execute.</p>\\n\\n<p>At this point, you have built a package manager. You just avoid calling it one. You have versioned prompt modules, a dependency resolver, a lockfile, a specification language, and the growing realization that what you actually want is a deterministic, formally specified description of behavior that produces the same output every time. Or, to borrow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule\">Greenspun’s tenth rule</a>:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Any sufficiently complicated prompt registry contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a package manager.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This assumes good faith throughout. The prompt registry would also face supply chain attacks targeted directly at LLMs and AI coding agents, from <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/01/promptver.html\">prompt injection via package metadata</a> to <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/10/slopsquatting-meets-dependency-confusion.html\">slopsquatting combined with dependency confusion</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"what-packages-provide\">What packages provide</h3>\\n\\n<p>A package’s value isn’t primarily its implementation code. Anyone can rewrite curl in Rust in a weekend, as Daniel Stenberg has <a href=\"https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/05/20/i-could-rewrite-curl/\">heard many times</a>. What they can’t rewrite is the twenty years of bug reports, the weird edge cases someone hit in production and took the time to fix, the arguments in issue threads that eventually settled on the right behavior. That knowledge is spread across the package’s history and it grew organically. No prompt captures it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Package names and version numbers are flags that people rally around. They’re points of coordination that developers come back to later to check whether someone made an improvement. When a maintainer fixes a bug in a widely-used library, that fix flows outward through the dependency graph. Thousands of projects get the improvement by running a version update. Nobody coordinated this. The maintainer didn’t know most of the downstream consumers existed. The downstream developers didn’t need to understand the internals of the fix. Semver gave them a protocol for expressing “this is safe to take” without requiring explicit coordination between every pair of producer and consumer.</p>\\n\\n<p>Michiel Buddingh wrote about the <a href=\"https://michiel.buddingh.eu/enclosure-feedback-loop\">enclosure feedback loop</a> in AI: as developers move from public forums to private AI assistants, collective knowledge gets fenced off and the commons degrades. Package ecosystems are the opposite dynamic. Knowledge flows outward through shared code, and improvements compound over time. Each independently maintained library gets better over time through bug reports, security patches, performance work and feature additions from people who actually use it in production. The improvements are unevenly distributed and sometimes messy, but they accumulate. A project with 200 dependencies is quietly benefiting from the maintenance work of hundreds of people it has no direct relationship with.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the prompt registry world, that loop is broken. You generate your HTTP client code from a prompt. Six months later, someone discovers a subtle TLS verification bug in the pattern that prompt tends to produce. In the package manager world, the library maintainer fixes it, cuts a release, and you update. In the prompt world, your code is already generated, sitting in your repo, probably modified since then. The prompt itself might produce different code now because the underlying model has changed. You have no stable identity for what you’re running and no way to diff it against what the prompt produces today. Nobody else is running your exact output, so there’s no community finding bugs in the same code. Each generation is isolated.</p>\\n\\n<p>There’s something else the prompt registry assumes: that the prompt author has fully specified the behavior they want. But half the value of a mature library is behavior the author never thought to specify. It’s emergent correctness from years of bug reports. Someone hit a weird proxy configuration in 2019 and filed an issue. Someone else found a race condition under high concurrency in 2021. A third person noticed that a particular header combination broke on older TLS stacks. Each of those fixes is now baked into the library. You can’t prompt your way into a decade of production bug reports.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"who-governs-the-prompts\">Who governs the prompts</h3>\\n\\n<p>Package registries aren’t just file hosts. They decide who owns names, how disputes resolve, what gets removed, and how compromised accounts are handled. They’re <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/22/package-registries-are-governance-as-a-service.html\">governance providers</a>, making judgment calls that keep ecosystems healthy: removing malware, transferring abandoned packages, enforcing naming policies. When npm restored left-pad after Azer Koçulu unpublished it, that was a governance decision that kept thousands of builds from breaking. A prompt registry has none of this. Who decides that a prompt is malicious? Who resolves conflicts when two prompt authors claim the same specification name? Who steps in when a widely-used prompt starts producing vulnerable code? These are governance questions, and they need institutions to answer them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Yes, we’ve automated a lot of this collaboration, maybe too much if you’ve ever looked inside a node_modules folder. But underneath the automation there’s still a core human process: people building on each other’s work without needing to talk to each other, and that kind of coordination can’t be specified in a prompt.</p>\\n\\n<p>AI agents aren’t going to stop using packages. Packages feature heavily in the training data, and every coding agent already reaches for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">npm install</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip install</code> as a first instinct. The interesting work is happening in the opposite direction: making agents better at working <em>with</em> package managers rather than replacing them. I’ve been building <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/21/an-ai-skill-for-skeptical-dependency-management.html\">a skill that makes coding agents evaluate packages skeptically</a> before suggesting them, checking that they exist, that they’re maintained, that the standard library doesn’t already cover the use case. There’s also a broader opportunity to give agents a <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/22/a-protocol-for-package-management.html\">shared protocol for package management</a>, a common vocabulary for resolution, publishing and governance that works across ecosystems. <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/23/package-management-is-a-wicked-problem.html\">Package management is a wicked problem</a>, and AI that understands package managers deeply seems more useful than AI that tries to make them disappear.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://www.construction-physics.com/feed', 'value': '<p>A theory that has gained traction in the renewable energy space is that renewable energy sources like wind and solar are based on manufactured &#8220;technologies&#8221;, while fossil fuel energy sources like oil, coal, and natural gas are based on extracted &#8220;commodities&#8221;. Per this theory, technologies can take advantage of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-accurate-are-learning-curves\">learning</a> <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/where-are-my-damn-learning-curves\">curves</a>, and thus will continue to get cheaper as they&#8217;re deployed in larger and larger volumes; <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/do-commodities-get-cheaper-over-time\">commodities</a>, on the other hand, don&#8217;t have learning curves, and thus can&#8217;t be expected to get cheaper over time.</p><p>Here, for instance, is a <a href=\"https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf\">report from the Rocky Mountain Institute</a> advancing this theory:</p><blockquote><p><em>There are two main perspectives on the energy transition: the old incumbent view of business-as-usual; and the new insurgent view of exponential change. At heart this is the longstanding battle of commodities versus technologies. Design and technologies beat commodities because they enjoy learning curves and are limitless. So costs fall over time, and growth is exponential. New energy comes from manufactured, modular, scalable, clean technologies; old energy is from centralized, heavy, dirty commodities.</em></p></blockquote><p>This theory obviously favors increasing the rollout of renewable energy; the more renewables we build, the cheaper our energy will get, whereas if we stick with fossil fuels we can&#8217;t expect that to happen.</p><p>Folks referencing this theory seem to disagree as to the exact mechanisms that are driving the difference between price trends in technologies and commodities. The same Rocky Mountain Institute report suggests it&#8217;s because commodities have depletion dynamics and because cartels like OPEC can control the price:</p><blockquote><p><em>Individual fossil fuel technologies of course do have learning curves; but because of depletion and cartels, fossil fuel prices have not shown structural decline over time.</em></p></blockquote><p>Someone else suggested to me that what this distinction is really getting at is <em>elasticity of supply </em>&#8212; that it&#8217;s much more straightforward to scale up the production of technologies than it is for commodities.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511000474\">2011 paper from McNerney et al.</a> on the historical price of coal-fired electricity suggests the difference is more about commodities being easily tradable:</p><blockquote><p><em>Coal prices have fluctuated and shown no overall trend up or down; they became the most important determinant of fuel costs when average thermal efficiencies ceased improving in the U.S. during the 1960s. This fluctuation and lack of trend are consistent with the fact that coal is a traded commodity, and therefore, it should not be possible to make easy arbitrage profits by trading it. According to standard results in the theory of finance, this implies that it should follow a random walk. In contrast, plant construction costs, the most important determinant of capital costs, followed a decreasing trajectory until 1970, consistent with what one expects from a technology.</em></p></blockquote><p>(I don&#8217;t think this makes a ton of sense &#8212; as we&#8217;ll see, something being tradable doesn&#8217;t preclude it from getting cheaper over time &#8212; but I wanted to flag it as a mechanism folks use to explain the difference between technologies and commodities.)</p><p>Regardless of the mechanisms, I think the &#8220;technologies vs. commodities&#8221; theory is, in practice, actually bundling a few different questions together:</p><ul><li><p>To what extent can technologies and commodities be expected to decline in price over time?</p></li><li><p>Relatedly,  to what extent are technologies and commodities subject to different dynamics that will affect their price?</p></li><li><p>And finally, do commodities exhibit learning curves &#8212; that is, does their price decline as a function of cumulative production volume?</p></li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s look at each one of these questions and try to answer them.</p><h4>Do commodities get cheaper over time?</h4><p>I think the idea that technologies (and more generally, manufactured goods) tend to exhibit declining prices over time is pretty clearly true. When <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052669\">Nagy et al. 2013</a> used the <a href=\"https://pcdb.santafe.edu/process_view.php\">performance curve database</a> to analyze cost trends for 62 different technologies, they found that Moore&#8217;s Law (prices decreasing exponentially with time) was nearly as good as Wright&#8217;s Law (prices decreasing exponentially with production volume) at predicting future prices. And if we create our own version of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-tvs-get-so-cheap\">the famous AEI chart</a>, and look at the cost trends of different categories of manufactured goods in the Consumer Price Index, we find that they almost all get cheaper in inflation-adjusted terms over time.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!azQo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76002ee1-bfd8-46a2-b87a-e0dbba60fd1a_665x989.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!azQo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76002ee1-bfd8-46a2-b87a-e0dbba60fd1a_665x989.png\" width=\"665\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But as we <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/do-commodities-get-cheaper-over-time\">noted last week</a>, it&#8217;s also common for commodities to get cheaper over time. 24 of 25 different agricultural commodities we looked at got cheaper over their time series, and 60 of 93 different mineral commodities were.

Below are graphs showing the average annual real price change for 124 different commodities, and for 67 different categories of manufactured goods in the Consumer Price Index, over 20 year windows of time. (So iron ore, which has price data from 1900 to 1921, is broken into price windows from 1900 to 1919, 1920 to 1939, etc. and an average rate of real price change is calculated for each window.) We can see that while both commodities and manufactured goods have a tendency to get cheaper over time (seen as a left skew on the graph), the tendency is greater for manufactured goods.</p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>(Note that this isn&#8217;t a 1 to 1 comparison. Most manufactured good inflation data is post-1980, while the commodity price data in general stretches back much farther.)</p><p>The difference is even more stark if we just look at the 20-year period from 2000 to 2020. Manufactured goods still have a tendency to get cheaper, but commodities no longer do.</p><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><div class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" id=\"datawrapper-iframe\"></div><p>So contra the &#8220;technologies vs. commodities&#8221; theory, both technologies and commodities can get cheaper over time, but technologies seem to have more consistent price declines, particularly recently.</p><h4>Do commodities and technologies have different price dynamics?</h4><p>I think it&#8217;s true that there are, broadly, somewhat different dynamics at work when it comes to the prices of technologies vs. commodities. Commodities (as I noted <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/do-commodities-get-cheaper-over-time\">last week</a>, and as the Rocky Mountain Institute <a href=\"https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf\">report</a> argues) can be subject to depletion dynamics: getting used up in a particular location. And because they&#8217;re often found in specific locations, it&#8217;s perhaps easier to control the supply of commodities and use that control to manipulate the price. OPEC was famously able to effectively control the price of oil for many years, and De Beers was able to control almost the entire world&#8217;s supply of diamonds for over a century to keep prices artificially high.</p><p>But I think there&#8217;s also a significant amount of overlap in the price and production dynamics of technologies and commodities. Commodities mined from the earth are still a product of technology, of some particular process that gets used to extract, refine, and transport them. Like with manufacturing processes, this production process can be improved and made more efficient over time. The technology used to drill oil and natural gas wells has improved enormously over time thanks to the development of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-learning-by-doing-looks-like\">PDC drill bits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-technological-innovations-that\">hydraulic fracking</a>. These and other technical improvements have allowed oil producers to get <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64124\">more and more oil from fewer and fewer drilling rigs</a>.</p><p>These productivity improvements haven&#8217;t cashed out as drops in the price of oil, but for other commodities process improvements have resulted in price declines. Most widely-used metal commodities &#8212; steel, aluminum, titanium &#8212; saw dramatic price declines following technological process improvements. (The introduction of the Bessemer process, the Hall-Herroult process, and the Kroll process respectively.)</p><p>Conversely, the depletion dynamics and diseconomies of scale that commodities can be subjected to can also be at work with technologies. Wind power may be a &#8220;technology&#8221; in the sense that it&#8217;s produced via repetitively manufactured wind turbines which need no consumable fuel, but a wind turbine needs to be installed somewhere where the wind is blowing, and there&#8217;s only so many places where the wind blows enough for wind power to be practical. Models of available wind resources in the US, for instance, show <a href=\"https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/85075.pdf\">increasing cost of wind-generated electricity as deployment rises</a> because the best, windiest sites get occupied first, and because <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X2300430X\">wake effects</a> from a wind farm can reduce the energy generated from adjacent wind farms. Actual deployment of wind turbines appears to be <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X25003530\">more complex</a> than simply &#8220;the windiest sites get occupied first&#8221;, but reduced energy generation from wake effects is already an issue, and is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250506-renewable-energys-trouble-with-wind-theft\">projected to become more serious</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We have seen wake effects for years, and knew they happen,&#8221; says Ouro. &#8220;The problem is that in order to achieve net zero, we need to deploy a given amount of offshore wind capacity. So for 2030, we need to have three times more capacity than we have now, which means that in less than five years, we need to deploy thousands more turbines,&#8221; he explains.</em></p><p><em>&#8220;[Some of] these turbines are going to be operating very close to those that are already operating, so things are getting more and more crowded. So these wake effects are now starting to have more impact,&#8221; he says.</em></p></blockquote><p>Another important diseconomy of scale for wind and solar specifically is that as they get more widely deployed, they often become less popular. We see this dynamic with data centers, which used to be strongly favored by local communities (since they paid tax dollars but didn&#8217;t place much additional burden on local services) but now increasingly face opposition. And we&#8217;re seeing it with wind and solar, which are getting increasingly opposed by local residents. A <a href=\"https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/opposition-renewable-energy-facilities-united-states-may-2023-edition\">2023 report from Columbia</a> notes that &#8220;local opposition to renewable energy facilities is widespread and growing, and represents a potentially significant impediment to achievement of climate goals.&#8221; A <a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/state-and-local-permitting-restrictions-on-wind-energy-development/\">blog post from think tank R Street on wind energy permitting restrictions</a> similarly notes that:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8230;when we compare new ordinances to wind power generation in the United States, we see a matching trend, indicating that wind ordinances are likely a response to the increasing likelihood of living near permitted wind power. This would be consistent with findings that counties with or near wind power are also most likely to adopt restrictions on the development of wind power.</em></p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s possible to overcome or offset some of these dynamics technologically. Lower wind speeds, for instance, can be dealt with by using larger, taller wind turbines (up to the point where such turbines become infeasible to build on land due to transportation difficulties). Solar PV labor costs can be overcome by better automation for panel installation. But of course, it&#8217;s also possible to offset depletion dynamics technologically for commodities as well. Fracking is an obvious example, a technological development that made it possible to extract oil and natural gas from locations where it was previously infeasible or impractical to do so. Thanks to fracking, proven reserves of oil and natural gas in the US have <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/\">actually increased since the year 2000</a>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sf92!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e1a3e-5a72-419e-b4ba-6c3c50b6f681_983x552.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sf92!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e1a3e-5a72-419e-b4ba-6c3c50b6f681_983x552.png\" width=\"983\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Technologies can also be controlled by cartels, though my impression is that technology cartels are generally less successful than ones which try to control natural resources. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel\">Phoebus light bulb cartel,</a> which coordinated to artificially limit the lifespan of incandescent bulbs, only lasted for 14 years.</p><p>So in aggregate, there are probably somewhat different dynamics between commodities and technologies, but the boundaries between these categories are fairly fuzzy, and have a great deal of overlap. Commodity prices can decline over time thanks to technology improvements and economies of scale, and technologies can be affected by depletion dynamics and other diseconomies.</p><h4>Do commodities have learning curves?</h4><p>Determining if commodities have learning curves &#8212; that is, if they fall in price as a function of cumulative production volume &#8212; turns out to be a complicated question. If you just graph price vs. production volume data for various commodities, very few seem like they&#8217;re following any sort of learning curve, showing nice straight or mostly-straight lines going down and to the right on a log-log plot. The USGS mineral commodity datasets, include worldwide production volume for various mineral commodities going back to 1900. Some of these look like they&#8217;re following a learning curve, but most don&#8217;t.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NuED!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d3aee54-126d-43a3-9389-d9d438d342f2_1506x1124.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1087\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NuED!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d3aee54-126d-43a3-9389-d9d438d342f2_1506x1124.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Similarly, USDA crop datasets include annual quantities harvested, which we can use to construct a learning curve.

Instead, we&#8217;re graphing price against production volume starting at some particular point in time. USGS mineral commodity data goes back to 1900, but most of those commodities were being produced long before 1900. Some minerals, like gypsum, copper, iron, and lime, have been mined for thousands of years.</p><p>Agricultural commodities have the same problem &#8212; crops were being harvested in the US long before the USDA datasets began. The learning curves above are thus missing a large amount of production that occurred prior to the beginning of the dataset.</p><p>If some amount of early production is missing from your learning curve dataset, this will distort the linear relationship between price and cumulative production on a log-log chart. Say you&#8217;ve produced 1000 units of something total. If you&#8217;re following a normal learning curve, you shouldn&#8217;t expect costs to fall very much over the next 20 units: going from 1000 to 1020 is only a small fraction of a doubling, and learning curves will (theoretically) have a constant percentage decrease in cost for every doubling of cumulative production volume. Thus a very small decline in price is expected. But what if production data is missing, and you think you&#8217;ve only produced 10 units instead of 1000. Now the next 20 units is a much larger fraction of production: you think you&#8217;re going from 10 to 30, more than tripling cumulative production. Now a very small decline in price looks like a very flat learning curve.</p><p>The graphs below show several learning curves. The first is the &#8220;true&#8221; learning curve with all the production data intact. The other graphs have various amounts of early production data missing, causing the graph to incorrectly start at an earlier point. The more production is omitted, the more the learning curve flattens out and deviates from the true curve. And it doesn&#8217;t take much omitted data to really distort the curves, so even the fact that most commodity use is fairly recent doesn&#8217;t rescue us from this problem.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GSfA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb385579-db50-4aa2-821d-75e10c325fe4_731x441.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GSfA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb385579-db50-4aa2-821d-75e10c325fe4_731x441.png\" width=\"731\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>(Thanks to Matt Clancy for pointing this out.)</p><p>Because many commodities have been mined or harvested for centuries or millennia, it&#8217;s hard to get an accurate sense of what cumulative production volume truly is. This makes commodities different from technologies or manufactured goods, where it&#8217;s much easier to determine both when production started and what cumulative production is. Without good estimates of actual cumulative production volume, it&#8217;s hard to tell whether commodities follow learning curves or not.</p><p>Interestingly, for a few commodities where we can be confident we&#8217;re not missing much (if any) production volume, we often get something much more learning curve-like. Titanium metal, which basically didn&#8217;t exist prior to the 20th century, follows a nice learning curve. Aluminum was only produced in tiny amounts prior to the invention of the Hall-Herroult process, and also follows a nice learning curve.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t universally true. The USGS helium dataset probably covers almost all cumulative production (since helium <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium#History\">wasn&#8217;t isolated until 1895</a>), but its price history doesn&#8217;t appear especially learning curve-like, possibly due to government price controls or because it&#8217;s almost entirely a byproduct of natural gas extraction. But it nevertheless seems notable.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Overall I think the &#8220;technologies vs. commodities&#8221; theory gets at a real, meaningful distinction. Manufactured goods do seem more likely to decline in price over time than extracted commodities, and are probably broadly subject to somewhat different price dynamics. It&#8217;s also pretty unclear if commodities generally follow learning curves the way that manufactured goods do.</p><p>But this distinction is blurry, and in practice there&#8217;s a lot of overlap between the two categories. Both commodities and technologies can have falling prices thanks to efficiency-enhancing production improvements, and both can be subject to depletion effects or other diseconomies of scale. And at the limit, the price of some technology should <a href=\"https://www.jaakkoj.com/concepts/idiot-index\">approach the price of its raw material inputs</a>, making it in effect a bundle of commodities. For energy technologies (the only place I&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;technology vs. commodity&#8221; distinction get made), there are also plenty of cases where the distinction breaks down. Hydropower isn&#8217;t commodity-based (in the sense that it doesn&#8217;t burn any fuel), but it also isn&#8217;t the product of modular, repetitively manufactured goods like wind and solar are. And it&#8217;s subject to severe depletion dynamics, since there&#8217;s only so many places you can build a hydroelectric dam.</p><p>(I also find the &#8220;technologies vs. commodities&#8221; concept sort of philosophically irritating, as every aspect of civilization, from manufactured goods to commodities like steel, oil, and corn, is a product of technology.)</p><p>So while I don&#8217;t think the distinction between technologies and commodities is meaningless, I also don&#8217;t think it does a particularly good job of carving reality at the joints. I think folks would be better served talking about the specific dynamics at work, and the specific problems that need to be solved, rather than thinking in terms of what, in practice, is a pretty fuzzy abstraction.</p><p><em>Thanks to Matt Clancy and Austin Vernon for reading a draft of this.

Indeed, the very start of this story dates back to 1998.</p>\\n<p>It starts in Washington, in October, 1998, when Bill Clinton signed a big, gnarly bill called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (or DMCA) into law. Section 1201 &#8211; the \"anti-circumvention clause\" &#8211; of the DMCA establishes a new felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for anyone who bypasses an \"access control\" while modifying a digital system.</p>\\n<p>These penalties apply irrespective of <em>why</em> you\\'re making that modification, and they apply even if the device you\\'re modifying is <em>your own property</em>. Which means that if the manufacturer decides you shouldn\\'t be able to do something with your digital device, well, you can\\'t do it. Even if it\\'s yours. Even if the thing you want to do is perfectly legal.</p>\\n<p>Right from the start, it was clear that this law was a bad idea. It was an enshittifier\\'s charter. Once you ban users from modifying their own property, you leave them defenceless. The manufacturer can sell you a gadget and then push an over-the-air update that degrades its functionality, and then demand that you pay a monthly \"subscription\" fee to get that functionality back.</p>\\n<p>This is a law purpose-built for anyone who aspires to graduate from the Darth Vader MBA, where the first and only lesson is, \"I\\'m altering the deal. Pray I don\\'t alter it any further.\"</p>\\n<p>Immediately upon the passage of this bill, two things happened: first, American tech companies started to rip off the American public, taking advantage of the fact that it was now a crime to disenshittify your own property; and second, the US Trade Representative went around the world in search of biddable public officials who could be flattered or bullied into bringing an anti-circumvention law onto their own country\\'s lawbooks.</p>\\n<p>The US <em>had</em> to get all its trading partners to pass these laws, otherwise those countries\\' own tech companies would go into business selling tools to disenshittify America\\'s defective tech exports: privacy blockers, jailbreaks, alternative clients, generic consumables, diagnostic tools, compatible parts and spares.</p>\\n<p>But if America could arm-twist its trading partners into passing anti-circumvention laws, then those countries would shut down any tech entrepreneurs who posed a competitive threat to America\\'s metastasizing, inbred tech giants, and the people in those countries would be easy pickings for America\\'s tech giants as they plundered the world\\'s cash and data.</p>\\n<p>Right from the start, the US Trade Rep targeted Canada for these demands. The only problem was that Canadians <em>hated</em> anti-circumvention law. We\\'d had a front row seat to all the ways that our American cousins were getting fleeced by their tech companies, and we had no desire to share their plight.</p>\\n<p>Plus, we\\'ve got some smart nerds here who could easily see themselves exporting very lucrative tools of technological liberation across the southern border. Hell, if we can supply America with reasonably priced pharmaceuticals through the mails, then we can surely sell them excellent anti-ripoff mods over the internet.</p>\\n<p>Paul Martin\\'s Liberals took two runs at passing anti-circumvention law but failed hard. The architect of this project, a Toronto MP named Sam Bulte lost her seat over it, and the Liberal brand became so toxic in Parkdale-High Park that the seat flipped to the NDP for a generation.</p>\\n<p>Then it was Stephen Harper\\'s turn. First, he tasked Jim Prentice with getting an anti-circumvention law through Parliament, and when Prentice failed, Harper turned to Industry Minister Tony Clement and Heritage Minister James Moore with getting the ball over the line. Clement and Moore tried to rehabilitate the idea of anti-circumvention with a public consultation: \"See? We\\'re listening!\"</p>\\n<p>Boy, did <em>that</em> backfire. 6,138 of us wrote into the consultation to condemn the proposal. 53 Vichy nerds wrote in to support it.</p>\\n<p>Moore was clearly stung. Shortly after the consultation, he gave a keynote to the International Chamber of Commerce meeting in Toronto, where he dismissed all 6,138 of us as \"babyish&#8230;radical extremists.\"</p>\\n<p>Then Harper whipped his caucus and passed Bill C-11, The Copyright Modernization Act, in 2012, pasting America\\'s anti-circumvention law into our lawbooks. Now, I don\\'t think that Moore and Clement were particularly motivated by their love of digital locks. Nor was Stephen Harper. Rather, they were under threat from the US Trade Representative, who told them that America would whack us with tariffs if we failed to arrange a hospitable environment for America\\'s tech companies.</p>\\n<p>Well, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard, but Trump whacked us with tariffs <em>anyway</em>. When someone threatens to burn your house down unless you do as you\\'re told, and they burn your house down anyway, you don\\'t have to keep taking their orders. Indeed, you\\'re a sucker if you do.</p>\\n<p>In the 15 years since we capitulated to America\\'s policy demands, US Big Tech has grown too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care.</p>\\n<p>To Canada\\'s credit, we\\'ve tried a bunch of things to rein in Big Tech:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We tried to get them to pay to link to the news (instead, they just blocked all Canadian news);</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We tried to get them to include Canadian content in their streaming libraries (they lobbied, sued and bullied their way out of it);</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We tried to make them pay a 3% tax, despite the fiction that all their profits are floating in a state of untaxable grace in the Irish Sea (and they got Trump to terrify Carney into walking it back).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This is the \"too big to jail\" part. When a company is a couple orders of magnitude larger than your government, what hope do you have of regulating it? Back a couple years ago, when America\\'s antitrust regulators were also riding Big Tech\\'s ass, there was a chance that we could make a rule and they would help us make it stick.</p>\\n<p>But now that the CEOs of all the Big Tech companies personally gave the Trump campaign a million bucks each for a seat on the inauguration dais, and now that all the tech giants have donated millions to Trump\\'s new Epstein Memorial Ballroom at the White House, and now that Apple CEO Tim Cook has assembled a gilded participation trophy for Trump on camera, we\\'ve got no hope of getting Big Tech to colour inside the lines.</p>\\n<p>So what are we to do?</p>\\n<p>Well, we could continue with our current response to the Trump tariffs. You know: retaliatory tariffs, where we make everything Canadians buy <em>more</em> expensive, because Canadians are famous for just loving it when their prices go up. This is a great way to punish Trump. It\\'s like punching ourselves in the face as hard as we can, and hoping the downstairs neighbour says \"ouch.\"</p>\\n<p>But there\\'s another way: now that we\\'re living with the tariffs we were promised we could avoid by passing an anti-circumvention law, why don\\'t we get rid of that law? There is <em>so much money</em> waiting for us if we go into business disenshittifying America\\'s defective tech products.</p>\\n<p>Take just one example: app stores. Apple takes 30 cents out of every dollar that an Apple user spends in an app. If your app tries to use another payment method, they\\'ll turf it out of the App Store. And of course, iPhone owners can\\'t replace Apple\\'s app store with another one, because the iPhone has an \"access control,\" so it\\'s a crime to change your app store.</p>\\n<p>30% is an <em>insane</em> transaction rake. I mean, here in Canada, we make person-to-person payments for <em>free</em>. Visa &#8211; an enshittified monopolist if ever there was one &#8211; charges 3-5%. Apple charges Thirty. Percent.</p>\\n<p>Do you have any idea how lucrative this is? It is literally the most lucrative line of business Apple is in. It makes Apple more pure profit than any other line of business, even more than the $20b cash bribe Google pays them every year not to make a competing search engine. $20b is chump-change. Apple makes <em>one hundred billion dollars a year</em> on this racket.</p>\\n<p>They impose a 30% tax on the whole digital economy, and they get to self-preference. So if you want to sell ebooks or videos on an app, Apple charges you 30%, but when Apple sells ebooks and videos on its own apps, it doesn\\'t charge itself 30%. And they get to structure the market. They can exclude any app they want, for any reason, and then no Apple customer in the world can have that app.</p>\\n<p>Last fall, Apple banned an app called \"ICE Block.\" That\\'s an app that warns you if there are ICE thugs nearby, so you can avoid getting kidnapped and sent to a Salvadoran slave-labor camp or shot in the face by a guy with a Waffen SS tattoo under his plate carrier and a mask over his nose. Apple classed ICE murderers as a \"protected class\" and yanked the app.</p>\\n<p>So imagine for a sec that Canada repealed Bill C-11, belatedly heeding the advice of those 6,138 people who wrote into James Moore and Tony Clement\\'s consultation to warn them, basically, that this was going to happen. When that happens, some smart Waterloo grads, backed by some RIM money, can go into business making jailbreaking kits and app store infrastructure for iPhones, and they can sell these to everyone in the world who wants to operate their own app store, who wants to compete with Apple.</p>\\n<p>Offer the world a 90% discount on Apple\\'s app tax, and you\\'re talking about a ten billion dollar/year business. Maybe Canada will never have another RIM, but RIM had a tough business. They had to make hardware, which is risky and capital intensive. Legalize jailbreaking and we can let <em>Apple</em> make the hardware, and then we can cream off the hundred billion dollars in rents they book <em>every year</em>. That\\'s a <em>much</em> better business to be in.</p>\\n<p>You know what Jeff Bezos said to a roomful of publishers when he started Amazon? \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" But these guys are such crybabies. When they do it to us it\\'s progress; when we do it to them, it\\'s piracy.</p>\\n<p>I mean, come on. Elbows up, right? Move fast and break <em>their</em> things. Move fast and break <em>kings</em>.</p>\\n<p>You know all that stuff we failed to get Big Tech to do? Pay for news, put cancon in their streaming lineups? This is how we get it. We can\\'t make Apple or Google or Netflix change their software. We can fine \\'em, sure, but Trump will just order his judges not to issue court orders when we try to collect, and ban his banks from transferring the money.</p>\\n<p>In any game, the ref has to be more powerful than the players on the field. Otherwise, they\\'ll do exactly what Big Tech has done to us: ignore our rulings and keep on cheating.</p>\\n<p>We don\\'t have any hope of controlling what Big Tech does, but there is one thing we have total, absolute control over: what <em>we</em> do. We don\\'t have to let American companies make use of our courts to shut down Canadian companies that disenshittify their defective products. The laws of Canada are under total and final Canadian control. Repeal Bill C-11, legalize jailbreaking, and we\\'ll unshackle our technologists and entrepreneurs, and sic \\'em on those subpar American products.</p>\\n<p>Meta takes the news out of its apps? Let \\'em! We\\'ll just start selling a multiprotocol alt-client, one that merges your Facebook, Insta, Twitter, Linkedin, Bluesky, and Mastodon feeds, blocks all the ads, blocks all the tracking, <em>and</em> puts the news back in your feed.</p>\\n<p>Netflix won\\'t put Canadian media in their library? Fine! We\\'ll start selling an alt client that lets Canadians search and stream from <em>all</em> the services they subscribe to, and adds in a PVR so you can record your favourite shows to watch later, or archive against the day that the streaming company ditches them. A video recorder would handily delete Amazon Prime\\'s grinchiest scam, where all the Christmas specials move from the free tier to $3.99 rentals in November, and go back into the free tier in March. Just record the kids\\' most beloved Christmas specials in July and bring \\'em out in December.</p>\\n<p>Think about this for a second: we <em>uninvented</em> the VCR. The VCR, one of the most popular, transformative technologies in modern history. A wildly profitable technology, too. Once all the video went digital, and once all the digital video threw in an \"access control\" that blocked recording, it became a crime to record digital cable, satellite, or streaming, unless you used the service\\'s own PVR, which won\\'t let you tape some shows, or skip ads, and which deletes your stored shows when the broadcaster decides you don\\'t deserve to have them anymore.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s not illegal to record a video stream, no more than it was illegal to record a TV show off your analog cable or broadcast receiver. The same fair dealing exemptions apply. But because it\\'s illegal to bypass an access control, and the access control blocks recording, we uninvented the VCR. We made the VCR illegal. Not because Parliament ever passed a law banning VCRs, but because our anti-circumvention law allows dominant corporations to simply decide that certain conduct that they disprefer should no longer occur.</p>\\n<p>With Bill C-11, we\\'ve created \"felony contempt of business model.\" In living memory, video recording changed the world and made billions of dollars. Today, we\\'ve all lost our video recorders. But we have more reason than ever to want a video recorder; to <em>pay</em> for a video recorder. There\\'s fantastic amounts of money just sitting there on the table, money we\\'ve prohibited our entrepreneurs from making, in order to prevent the US from hitting us with the tariffs that they\\'ve just hit us with.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s be clear here: no one has the right to a profit. If you\\'ve got a business that sucks, and I make it not suck anymore, and your customers start paying me instead of you, well, that sounds like a <em>you</em> problem to me. I mean, does the Canadian government really want to decide which desirable products can and can\\'t exist?</p>\\n<p>Look, I\\'ve mainlined Tommy Douglas since I was in red diapers, but that sounds pretty commie, even to me.</p>\\n<p>Which brings me to Canada\\'s own sclerotic, monopoly-heavy commercial environment. After all, Canada is two monopolists and a mining company in a trenchcoat. Which is not to say that our oligarchs are weak. They love to throw their weight around. I guess owning an entire maritime province can go to your head.</p>\\n<p>Will any of these guys step up to cape for America\\'s tech giants? Do any of them benefit from our voluntary decision to let America walk all over us? Not really. But a little, at the margins. Guys like Ted Rogers make a lot of money by making us rent set-top boxes for our cable, which lock out recorders. Re-invent the VCR and Ted Rogers might have to sell his ivory-handled back-scratcher collection.</p>\\n<p>But let him squawk! He can afford the loss, and lest we forget, Ted Rogers made his second fortune renting us video cassettes to stick in our VCRs. When he did it, it was progress. If we do it to him, that\\'s not piracy.</p>\\n<p>Man, there is <em>so much money</em> to be made by becoming the disenshittification nation. It\\'s not just payments or video recorders. One of the main uses of access controls is blocking generic consumables, like inkjet ink. Parliament never made a law saying that people who buy a printer from HP have to buy their ink from HP, too. But because we made it illegal to bypass an access control, and because HP uses access controls to block generic ink, it\\'s a felony to use cheap ink in your own printer.</p>\\n<p>The cartel of four giant inkjet companies know they have us trapped, and they have monotonically raised and raised and raised the price of ink, so that today, printer ink is the most expensive fluid a civilian can purchase without a government permit. At $10,000 per gallon, it would be cheaper to print your grocery lists with the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion.</p>\\n<p>Some smart Canadian technologists could buy every make and model of every printer, and prepare a library of jailbreaks that works across every one, and keep it up to date with every new software update as soon as it\\'s pushed. Everyone in the world who wants to refill ink cartridges or manufacture generics could pay that company $25/month for access to the jailbreaking library and for support if a customer ran into a problem.</p>\\n<p>Every manic entrepreneur running a corner store with a Bitcoin ATM, knife-sharpening and Amazon parcel dropoff could add inkjet ink to their line of business. Multiply every guy with a folding table at a dry-cleaner who\\'ll fix your phone or jailbreak your printer by $25/month, by 12 months/year, and you\\'ve got tens or hundreds of millions flowing into this country.</p>\\n<p>We would transform HP\\'s billions into our millions, and the rest would be shared among the world\\'s printer owners as a consumer surplus and freedom from a scummy rent-seeking racket.</p>\\n<p>There\\'s more!</p>\\n<p>Every mechanic is paying $10,000 per manufacturer per year for the diagnostic tool that decrypts the messages on your car\\'s CAN bus and turns your \"check engine\" light into an actual error, and you\\'d better bet your mechanic is passing that cost onto you. Canadian car hackers can buy every make and model of every car as it comes off the line, jailbreak it, and keep it jailbroken with every new over-the-air update, and sell every mechanic in the world a $50/month subscription to a bang up to date diagnostic tool.</p>\\n<p>The mechanic wins. The drivers win. Canada wins. The Big Three automakers eat dirt, which is fine. Looks like we\\'re buying Chinese cars from now on, anyway, and Parliament never passed a law guaranteeing perpetual profitability to legacy automakers whose most innovative ideas consist of finding ways to rent you the accelerator pedal in your car, and new markets to sell the driving data they steal from you.</p>\\n<p>All kinds of devices can\\'t be fixed because of our anti-circumvention law, Bill C-11. You\\'ve probably heard about the problems farmers have fixing their John Deere tractors. Farmers actually <em>do</em> the repairs on those tractors, installing the parts themselves, but the tractor\\'s main computer will not activate those parts until the farmer pays a couple hundred bucks for a callout by a John Deere rep, who enters an unlock code that tells the tractor that John Deere got paid for this repair.</p>\\n<p>Farmers have been fixing their implements since prehistory. Since the invention of the plow.</p>\\n<p>Beamish is Europe\\'s largest open-air museum, just outside of Newcastle. Here we\\'d call it a \"pioneer village.\" They\\'ve rescued and relocated a whole Victorian village high street, an Edwardian colliery and workers\\' cottages, vehicles from all eras of British history, and they\\'ve got a farmhouse that sits on a Roman foundation.</p>\\n<p>That farmhouse has a forge. Because of course it does. Farmers <em>have</em> to be able to fix their stuff, because when the storm is coming, and you need to get the crops in, you can\\'t wait for a service technician to find their way to the end of your lonely country road.</p>\\n<p>But John Deere has declared an end of history, and our Copyright Modernization Act let them do it. Farmers can\\'t fix their tractors anymore, not because Parliament ever passed the \"No Fixing Your Tractor Act.\" They didn\\'t need to. They just passed an act that banned circumvention of access controls, which lets John Deere &#8211; and other rapacious American monopolists &#8211; conjure new felonies out of thin air. There\\'s that \"felony contempt of business model\" again.</p>\\n<p>At this point you might be thinking, \"Hold on a sec, didn\\'t Trudeau whip his caucus to get a Right to Repair bill through Parliament in 2024?\" You\\'re right, he did: Bill C-244. It lets anyone fix anything&#8230;<em>unless</em> they have to bypass an access control in order to make the repair, in which case Bill C-11 makes that repair illegal. Canada\\'s got a Right to Repair law that\\'s big, bold, ambitious&#8230;and useless, a mere ornament, thanks to our anti-circumvention law, which we passed because the US promised us tariff-free access to US markets, a promise that the US has broken, and that we should never believe again.</p>\\n<p>Everything we\\'ve tried to do to make Canada safe for US tech exports has failed. They\\'ve failed because they\\'re redistributive. We told them they could keep stealing money from our news companies so long as they gave some of it back. We told them they could keep stealing money from people who need to fix their property so long as they follow some rules. We told them they could keep stealing money from our market participants so long as they mixed some cancon in with their streaming libraries. Even our privacy laws are redistributive: sure, go on stealing Canadians\\' data, just promise to limit the ways you abuse it to a short list of permissible human rights violations.</p>\\n<p>You know what\\'s better than redistribution? <em>Predistribution</em>. Rather than bargaining to recoup some of the value being stripmined from us, we can intervene technologically to prevent the theft in the first place: jailbreak our devices, abolish the app tax, block their monopoly ad insertions and replace them with open ad markets based on content, not surveillance, give users control over the media in their streaming libraries. Let Canadian businesses disenshittify our phones, TVs, tractors, cars and ventilators so anyone can fix them.</p>\\n<p>Ask any economist and they\\'ll tell you that the very best strategy is to have an open, fair system in the first place. Rather than tolerating and even enshrining unfairness in the system, and then begging the beneficiaries of that unfairness to dribble a few crumbs to the hungry victims at their feet.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps all of this is unconvincing to you. Maybe you\\'re not interested in our digital rights. Maybe you\\'re not excited by the prospect of turning America\\'s trillions into Canada\\'s billions. Well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve got something for you, too: national security.</p>\\n<p>Trump has made it clear that America no longer has allies or trading partners, it only has rivals and adversaries. He\\'s also made it clear that he cannot be mollified. Any concessions we make to him will be treated as a sign of weakness, and an invitation to demand more. Give him an inch, he\\'ll take a kilometer.</p>\\n<p>Give him an inch, he\\'ll take <em>Greenland</em>.</p>\\n<p>This is undeniably scary, because Trump has lots of non-kinetic options for pursuing his geopolitical aims. First among them is attacking his adversaries through his tech companies. He\\'s already started tinkering with this. When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the genocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump went through the roof, and Microsoft obliged him by shutting down the court\\'s access to its documents, emails, calendars and address books. They bricked the court.</p>\\n<p>Now, I should say here that Microsoft denies that they shut down the court to please Trump. They say it\\'s a coincidence. But when it comes to a \"he-said/Clippy-said\" dispute between the human rights defenders at the ICC and the convicted monopolists at Microsoft, I know who I believe. What\\'s more, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he \"couldn\\'t guarantee\" that Microsoft wouldn\\'t hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-centre. And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there\\'d be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it\\'s happening right now.</p>\\n<p>Trump has demonstrated that he will both bully and bribe US companies into doing his bidding. Cross him and he\\'ll put extra tariffs on the inputs you need to import from abroad, he\\'ll take away your key workers\\' visas and deport them, he\\'ll smack you with pretextual antitrust investigations, and sue you in his personal capacity.</p>\\n<p>But if you capitulate to him, he\\'ll give you no-bid government contracts, and hand you billions to provide surveillance gear and prison camps to help with his programme of ethnic cleansing. The tech companies are up to their eyeballs in Trump\\'s authoritarian takeover of the US. There\\'s no daylight between Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other US tech companies and the Trump regime.</p>\\n<p>You can be certain that if &#8211; when! &#8211; Trump orders these companies to shut down a government ministry (perhaps <em>your</em> ministry) or a corporation (perhaps <em>your</em> corporation) that they will do so.</p>\\n<p>Everyone in the world is waking up to this. In the EU, they\\'ve just created a new \"Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy\" czar, and they\\'re busily funding the \"Eurostack,\" a set of open, auditable replacements for US tech silos that can run on EU-based data-centres.</p>\\n<p>But they\\'re about to hit a wall. Because it doesn\\'t matter how great those Eurostack services are. If you can\\'t scrape, virtualize and jailbreak US Big Tech apps, so that you can exfiltrate your data, logs, file histories and permissions, no government ministry or large company can do that work by hand. It will challenge many households, who have entrusted US tech\\'s walled gardens with their financial data, family photos, groupchats, family calendars, and other structures that are not easily ported without cooperation from the tech giants. They are <em>not</em> going to cooperate with a mass exodus from their services. They will do everything they can to impede it.</p>\\n<p>Building the Eurostack without legalizing circumvention is like building housing for East Germans in West Berlin. It doesn\\'t matter how cool those apartments are, they\\'re gonna sit empty until you tear down the wall.</p>\\n<p>And administrative software is just for openers. Remember back in 2022, when Putin\\'s thugs looted millions of dollars\\' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine? These are permanently connected to John Deere\\'s cloud, which is how the John Deere company was able to trace them to Chechnya, and how they were able to send an over-the-air kill signal to the tractor that permanently bricked them.</p>\\n<p>And yes, I\\'ll freely admit that as a cyberpunk writer, this gives a little frisson of satisfaction. But if you only think about it for 10 seconds, you\\'ll realize that this means that Deere can immobilize <em>any</em> tractor in the world, or pretty much <em>every</em> tractor in Canada (and the rest of our tractors are likely from Massey Ferguson, another US giant also in thrall to Trump that can brick its tractors over the air, too).</p>\\n<p>This is exactly the threat we were warned of if we let Huawei supply our 5G infrastructure. Remember that? That whole \"Two Michaels\" business that we got stuck in when we let the US convince us that Huawei was gonna install landmines in our technological infrastructure? Well, you know how the saying goes: \"Every accusation is a confession.\"</p>\\n<p>But of course, China <em>could</em> brick the Chinese cloud-connected tech in Canada, like our solar inverters and batteries. The good news is that whether you\\'re a US natsec hawk or a China natsec hawk, you have the same path out of this trap. Namely: repealing Bill C-11, and legalizing circumvention so that we can deke out the locked bootloaders on our infrastructure and install open, auditable, transparent firmware on them. Because that is an infinitely more reliable way to render your systems into a known-good state than arresting random executives from giant Chinese companies.</p>\\n<p>And the good news is, everyone else in the world wants this, too, because they\\'re all facing the same risks as we are. So this isn\\'t really a <em>technological</em> project, in the sense of having a bunch of duelling firms all competing to come up with their own proprietary answer to an engineering problem. It\\'s more like a <em>scientific</em> project, in that we should have a commons, a git server filled with auditable, transparent, trustworthy drop-in code for whole classes of devices, from cars to TVs to smart speakers to ventilators to tractors to phone switches, that everyone contributes to and peer reviews.</p>\\n<p>We wouldn\\'t tolerate secrecy in our science. No one gets to keep the math used to calculate the load stresses on the joists holding the roof over our head a secret. We wouldn\\'t tolerate secrecy in the characteristics of the alloys in those joists, or even the wires carrying electricity through the walls. We should not tolerate secrecy in how our digital infrastructure works, either.</p>\\n<p>After all, a modern building is just a fancy casemod for a bunch of computers. Take all the computers out of a hospital and it becomes a morgue. There\\'s no secret medical science, and there should be no secret medical code, either.</p>\\n<p>So this is it. This is how we win. Trump has unwittingly recruited three armies to fight to end the enshittocene, the era in which all of our technology has turned to shit. There\\'s the digital rights hippies like me (who\\'ve been banging this drum since the 2000s); and then there\\'s the entrepreneurs and investors (eager for a chance to turn America\\'s tech trillions into Canada\\'s tech billions, making Canada into a global tech export powerhouse); and finally, there\\'s the national security hawks (who correctly worry that we are at risk of a kind of cyberwarfare the world has never seen before).</p>\\n<p>Normally, cyberwarfare involves hackers associated with an adversary state breaking into your critical systems, but Microsoft doesn\\'t have to break into your ministry\\'s Office365 and Outlook accounts to spy on you or brick your agencies. They already have root on your servers. For Trump, this is cyberwarfare on the easiest setting imaginable.</p>\\n<p>I started throwing this idea around right after Trump announced his first round of tariffs. There was this Canadian think-tank that was soliciting suggestions for Canadian countermeasures, and I sent them this stuff, and they said, \"Well, that would definitely <em>work</em>, but it\\'ll make Trump <em>really</em> mad at us.\"</p>\\n<p>Which, you know, <em>true</em>. But <em>anything</em> that works will make Trump mad at us. So again, I must fall back on my Canadian heritage here and apologize.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m sorry that I don\\'t have any empty gestures for us to deploy, only ideas for things that will work.</p>\\n<p>I mean, we can stick with the current plan, our retaliatory tariffs, which make everything we buy from America more expensive, and make us all poorer. That\\'ll do <em>something</em>. Like, it\\'ll certainly impose broad-spectrum pain on a bunch of American producers. If we decide to stop drinking delicious bourbon and switch to Wayne Gretzky\\'s undrinkable rye, there\\'s gonna be some corn farmer out there in a state that begins and ends with a vowel who\\'ll have trouble making payments on his John Deere tractor. But what did that farmer ever do to us?</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if we go into business selling everyone in the world (including that farmer) (including our <em>own</em> farmer) reliable, auditable, regulated, transparent drop-in firmware replacement for that tractor, then we free that farmer from the rent-extracting scams that John Deere uses to drain his bank account. And since we remain that guy\\'s customer, maybe he\\'ll side with us against Trump, along with the hundreds of millions of American technology users who we can also set free from the app tax, from commercial surveillance that feeds authoritarian state surveillance, from the repair ripoffs, from ink that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby winning stallion. They become our champions, too.</p>\\n<p>Because if we legalize jailbreaking, we will limit the blast radius of our counterattack, to the tech barons who each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais and their shareholders, who are not everyday Americans. Everyday Americans have gotten poorer every year for 50 years, thanks to wage stagnation, wage theft, economic bubbles and skyrocketing health, education and housing costs.</p>\\n<p>They\\'ll tell you that most Americans own stock, but the amount of stock the average American holds rounds to zero. Nearly all US stock is held by the richest 10% of Americans &#8211; the ones who are backing Trump and getting rich off Trump &#8211; and legalizing jailbreaking is a targeted strike on <em>just</em> those people, which will only benefit our American cousins, the everyday people who\\'ve been abused for generations by these eminently guillotineable plutocrats.</p>\\n<p>Canada is in a good position to do this. We\\'ve got motive, means and opportunity, but we\\'re not the only ones. Most of the countries in the world are situated to take advantage of this opportunity, to become the \"disenshittification nation\" that supplies the world with wildly profitable software tools that fix America\\'s defective technology.</p>\\n<p>All it takes is one country defecting. That country gets to reap the benefit &#8211; the billions &#8211; of exporting those tools to the world, while the rest of us only get to enjoy the consumer surplus, the technology that works better and costs us less money and privacy to use.</p>\\n<p>You know how Ireland defected from the world\\'s tax treaties and, through regulatory arbitrage, made billions luring the world\\'s largest companies to establish domicile in Dublin, while depriving the world\\'s tax collectors of trillions? Regulatory arbitrage is the game everyone can play. When a country decides to become the Ireland for disenshittification, the nation where it\\'s legal to jailbreak locked technology, and export the tools to do so to everyone in the world with an internet connection and a payment method, they will get to reap the largest benefit. They\\'ll grab the hoarded monopoly rents of America\\'s tech giants and use them as fuel for a single-use rocket that launches their domestic tech sector into a stable orbit for generations.</p>\\n<p>Those American tech companies <em>need</em> to be relieved of the dead capital on their balance sheets. What are these companies doing with their looted trillions? Blowing it all on AI. They tell you there\\'s a lot of money to be made with AI, but no one can tell you where it\\'s going to come from.</p>\\n<p>This month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he\\'s going to recoup the hundreds of billions of dollars he\\'s pissed away on AI by turning Google into the world\\'s perfect engine for surveillance pricing. That\\'s when a company uses surveillance data to predict how desperate you are, and jacks up the price to the highest amount they think they can get you to part with.</p>\\n<p>This is a terrible idea of course, but it\\'s not just terrible in the sense of \"this is an idea Google should be ashamed of.\" It\\'s terrible in the sense of \"this won\\'t work because everyone will hate it and refuse to participate in it.\" It\\'s just another harebrained scheme to finally find a way to make AI profitable, or at least less <em>unprofitable</em>.</p>\\n<p>Compare that with my anti-circumvention plan. I can tell you <em>exactly</em> where the money in my plan is going to come from: it\\'s just sitting there on Big Tech\\'s balance sheets, waiting for us to go get it. We\\'ll make money by making products that people want, because it will make their tech better, and they will pay us for them.</p>\\n<p>I mean, I know that sounds old-fashioned. But what can I say? Sometimes, the old ways are best.</p>\\n<p>If there\\'s one thing Canada is good at, it\\'s going to other countries and digging up all their wealth. America\\'s tech giants have buried trillions of dollars they stole from the world, and we know <em>exactly</em> where it is. What\\'s more, we can dig it out from here. No travel required!</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s go get it.</p>\\n<p>Their margin is our opportunity.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a

It uses <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">build.zig.zon</code> files for manifests and fetches dependencies directly from URLs, usually tarballs on GitHub. There’s no central registry yet, though the community runs unofficial indexes like <a href=\"https://github.com/zigtools/zpm\">zpm</a> and <a href=\"https://aquila.red/\">aquila</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/29/zig-and-the-mxn-supply-chain-problem.html#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\\n\\n<p>The package manager works well enough for declaring dependencies, fetching them, and building against them. The hard part is everything else: the ecosystem of tools, services, and infrastructure that makes a package manager usable in production.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/03/the-package-management-landscape.html\">The package management landscape</a> spans dozens of categories and hundreds of tools. For Zig to have the same tooling support as npm or Cargo, each of those tools either needs to add Zig support, or the Zig community needs to build alternatives.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"what-the-community-has-to-build\">What the community has to build</h3>\\n\\n<p>Some things only the Zig community can do. Nobody else will write the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">build.zig.zon</code> parser. Nobody else knows the resolution semantics. These are the parts that require language expertise:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Manifest and lockfile parsing.</strong> Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/librariesio/bibliothecary\">bibliothecary</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/syft\">syft</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/google/osv-scalibr\">osv-scalibr</a> parse dependency files across ecosystems. Each needs a Zig parser added. Right now, none of them support <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">build.zig.zon</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Vulnerability scanning.</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit\">pip-audit</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit\">bundler-audit</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec\">cargo-audit</a> are language-specific tools that check dependencies against advisory databases. Zig needs a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">zig-audit</code> equivalent, plus an advisory database to check against.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>SBOM generation.</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen\">cdxgen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/syft\">syft</a> generate SBOMs from project files. They need to understand Zig’s dependency format to include Zig packages in the bill of materials.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Dependency tree visualization.</strong> Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo tree</code>, npm has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">npm ls</code>. Zig needs something equivalent to show the resolved dependency graph.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Registry software.</strong> If Zig wants a central registry, someone has to build and run it. Crates.io, RubyGems.org, PyPI all required significant engineering effort. The unofficial indexes exist but aren’t authoritative.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>PURL and VERS types.</strong> The <a href=\"https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec\">Package URL spec</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/VERSION-RANGE-SPEC.rst\">version range spec</a> are standards, but they’re essentially maps of existing ecosystems rather than higher-order abstractions. Each new package manager has to propose a type, document its semantics, and get the PR merged. Zig doesn’t have a PURL type yet, so Zig packages can’t be referenced in SBOMs, advisory databases, or cross-ecosystem tooling in a standardized way.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"what-vendors-need-to-care-about\">What vendors need to care about</h3>\\n\\n<p>Other integrations require buy-in from companies who may not care about Zig yet. Market share matters here. If you’re a SaaS vendor prioritizing what to support next, Zig is competing against languages with larger user bases. Even if the Zig community does everything right, they’re still waiting on Dependabot, Renovate, and Snyk to care. You can’t get adoption without tooling, and you can’t get tooling without adoption.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Dependency update tools.</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/dependabot\">Dependabot</a> supports a fixed set of ecosystems. Adding a new one requires GitHub engineering time. <a href=\"https://www.mend.io/renovate/\">Renovate</a> is more extensible but still needs a <a href=\"https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/tree/main/lib/modules/manager\">manager plugin</a>, and neither supports Zig yet. There’s a <a href=\"https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/8166\">Dependabot issue</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/24309\">Renovate discussion</a>, both from 2023, both stalled.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Vulnerability databases.</strong> The <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories\">GitHub Advisory Database</a>, <a href=\"https://osv.dev\">OSV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/\">CVE.org</a> (MITRE), and the <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/\">NVD</a> all need to recognize Zig packages and file advisories against them using Zig’s identifier scheme. That requires agreeing on how to identify Zig packages, but there’s no PURL type for Zig yet.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>SCA tools.</strong> <a href=\"https://snyk.io\">Snyk</a>, <a href=\"https://socket.dev\">Socket</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com\">Sonatype</a>, and others would need to add Zig support. Each vendor makes independent decisions about what’s worth supporting.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Enterprise artifact repositories.</strong> <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/artifactory/\">JFrog Artifactory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository\">Sonatype Nexus</a> support proxying and hosting packages for many ecosystems, but Zig isn’t among them.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Metadata platforms.</strong> <a href=\"https://deps.dev\">deps.dev</a>, <a href=\"https://libraries.io\">Libraries.io</a>, and <a href=\"https://ecosyste.ms\">ecosyste.ms</a> aggregate package data across ecosystems. Each needs to understand Zig’s package format and index Zig packages from wherever they’re published.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Forge integrations.</strong> GitHub’s dependency graph, GitLab’s dependency scanning, and Gitea’s security features all need to parse Zig manifests to show Zig dependencies in their UIs.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"what-else-needs-updating\">What else needs updating</h3>\\n\\n<p><strong>SBOM formats.</strong> CycloneDX and SPDX have ecosystem-specific guidance. Zig needs representation in both.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Trusted publishing.</strong> PyPI’s <a href=\"https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/\">Trusted Publishers</a> and npm’s <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements\">provenance</a> rely on Sigstore and registry-specific OIDC flows. If Zig gets a central registry, it needs this infrastructure too.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"how-this-usually-goes\">How this usually goes</h3>\\n\\n<p>The typical path looks like this:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n  <li>Package manager ships with the language</li>\\n  <li>Early adopters manage dependencies manually</li>\\n  <li>Community builds minimal tooling (a parser here, an index there)</li>\\n  <li>Language gains traction, vendors start noticing</li>\\n  <li>Major tools add support one by one, in no particular order</li>\\n  <li>Eventually, enough coverage exists that the ecosystem feels complete</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>This process takes years. Go modules shipped in 2018 and still lacks full tooling parity with older ecosystems. Rust has been around since 2015 and Cargo is well-supported now, but that’s a decade of incremental integration.</p>\\n\\n<p>Somewhere along the way, package manager designers realize that some of their early decisions make integration harder. Maybe they didn’t assign unique identifiers to packages. Maybe their version scheme doesn’t map cleanly to PURL. Maybe they fetch dependencies from URLs instead of a registry, which breaks assumptions baked into every SBOM tool. By then, users depend on the current behavior. Changing a package manager after launch is like changing the hull of a submarine while it’s searching for the Titanic.</p>\\n\\n<p>Each new package manager goes through the same loop. Each tool vendor reimplements the same patterns: parse a manifest, extract dependencies, check against advisories. The work is duplicated dozens of times across the ecosystem, with each implementation making slightly different decisions about edge cases.</p>\\n\\n<p>Beyond the engineering, there’s human coordination. Shepherding PRs through repos maintained by volunteers with different priorities. Getting PURL proposals reviewed by a committee that meets sporadically. Convincing SCA vendors to prioritize your ecosystem over the next one in line. It’s part of why <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/23/package-management-is-a-wicked-problem.html\">package management is a wicked problem</a>: too many stakeholders, no single authority, solutions that create new problems.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"what-would-make-this-easier\">What would make this easier</h3>\\n\\n<p>Package management is in its pre-LSP era. Before the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/\">Language Server Protocol</a>, every IDE had to implement support for every language: M editors × N languages = M×N integrations. LSP changed that to M+N. Each editor implements the protocol once, each language implements a server once, and they all work together.</p>\\n\\n<p>Package management has the same M×N problem. Every tool (Dependabot, Snyk, Syft, deps.dev) implements support for every ecosystem (npm, PyPI, Cargo, Go) separately, each integration custom, and when Zig arrives it goes to the back of every queue.</p>\\n\\n<p>Every codebase is a dependency graph. The syntax varies, the resolution algorithms differ, the registries have different APIs, but the structure is the same: nodes are packages, edges are version constraints, and the goal is a consistent set of concrete versions. Zig’s graph looks like Cargo’s graph looks like npm’s graph, once you strip away the surface differences.</p>\\n\\n<p>We need a Dependency Lifecycle Protocol (DLP), an LSP for the package management world. In <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/22/a-protocol-for-package-management.html\">A Protocol for Package Management</a>, I sketched what this might look like: common definitions for manifest structure, resolution behavior, registry APIs. If it existed, a new package manager could implement against it. Tools that speak the protocol would get Zig support without each SCA vendor adding it separately.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"the-same-problem-twice\">The same problem twice</h3>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/28/the-dependency-layer-in-digital-sovereignty.html\">The dependency layer in digital sovereignty</a> makes a similar point from a different angle: dependencies are a chokepoint that nation-states and institutions don’t control. The Zig problem and the sovereignty problem are the same problem. One is “why can’t a new language ecosystem bootstrap quickly” and the other is “why can’t institutions control their own dependency infrastructure.” Both point to missing abstraction layers that would allow substitution.</p>\\n\\n<p>The lack of a protocol creates lock-in by default, through gravity more than malice. If you’re Zig, you need Dependabot and Snyk and GitHub’s dependency graph. If you’re a European institution, you need those same tools because that’s where the vulnerability data lives. A protocol would make the dependency layer contestable: run your own registry that federates with others, stand up a regional vulnerability database that speaks the same language, use tooling that isn’t controlled by three American companies.</p>\\n\\n<p>Governments already mandate standards for procurement: accessibility, security certifications, data residency. If US federal or EU procurement required dependency tooling that implements a common protocol, the incentive structure inverts. Government procurement is a massive market that moves in blocks. If you can’t sell to governments without protocol compliance, every vendor finds budget for it overnight. Zig gets support as a side effect: if Snyk implements the protocol to keep selling to governments, Zig gets coverage by conforming to the same spec.</p>\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act\">Cyber Resilience Act</a> is already pushing in this direction with SBOM requirements. PURL, OSV, and CycloneDX are attempts at standards, but they document what exists rather than defining what should exist. The CRA mandates outputs without mandating the interoperability layer that would make those outputs meaningful across ecosystems.</p>\\n\\n<p>Right now, the cost of launching a new package manager includes rebuilding the entire surrounding infrastructure. Languages stick with existing tools even when they’re not a great fit, because the integration burden is too high. Zig is going through this now, and <a href=\"https://rue-lang.dev/\">Rue</a>, a research language exploring memory safety with a gentler learning curve than Rust, doesn’t have a package manager yet. When it does, it will face the same integration slog, as will every new language until the protocol layer exists.</p>\\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\\n  <ol>\\n    <li id=\"fn:1\">\\n      <p>This is similar to how Go modules launched, fetching directly from version control hosts.

No jump table, just maths!</p>\\n\\n<p>If we mix up the code a bit so there\\'s no obvious relationship between the input and the return value:</p>\\n\\n<p>Still no jump table: Now the compiler has built a bespoke lookup table (<code>CSWTCH.1</code>) and then uses <code>x</code> to index into it (after checking it\\'s in bounds).</p>\\n\\n<p>For \"dense\" case statements, like the ones above, the compiler can be smart.

To fit the range of bits needed to cover all the whitespace characters, the compiler indexes into the bitmask with <code>(x - 9)</code>. The bit test instruction (<a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bt\"><code>bt</code></a>) will test any bit position, but our 32-bit bitmask only has meaningful data in positions 0-31. The compiler checks that <code>(x - 9) &lt;= 24</code> to ensure we\\'re within the valid range <sup id=\"fnref:wrap\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://xania.org/feed#fn:wrap\">2</a></sup> of the bitmask (covering tab at position 0 through space at position 23), and replaces the result with 0 for anything outside this range.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just to see what else the compiler can generate, let\\'s take a look at both a dense and sparse example that the compiler can\\'t replace with a table (you\\'ll need to scroll around in the Compiler Explorer panes to see more):</p>\\n\\n<p>For the dense case, the compiler does make a jump table, and indexes by <code>x</code> to jump to the right <code>func</code> routine<sup id=\"fnref:fall\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://xania.org/feed#fn:fall\">3</a></sup>. For the sparse case, the compiler has to fall back to essentially a set of <code>if()</code> statements, comparing and branching. However, it\\'s clever enough to compare a \"mid-range\" value first (<code>2511</code>), and if the <code>x</code> value is greater, jumps to code that only looks at the <code>5284</code> and <code>4865</code>. So it\\'s essentially a binary serarch tree of comparisons.</p>\\n\\n<p>Different compilers employ quite different tricks, so take some time to see what clang does for all the above examples.</p>\\n\\n<p>Write clear switch statements; let the compiler decide whether that means multiplication, bitmasks, or jump tables.

String comparisons seem straightforward enough - check the length, compare the bytes, done. But watch what Clang does when comparing against compile-time constants, and you\\'ll see some rather clever tricks involving overlapping memory reads and bitwise operations. What looks like it should be a call to <code>memcmp</code> becomes a handful of inline instructions that exploit the fact that the comparison value is known at compile time<sup id=\"fnref:gcc\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://xania.org/feed#fn:gcc\">1</a></sup>.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'ve set up nine functions that each compare a <code>std::string_view</code> against a constant string of increasing length, from one to nine characters. This gives us a chance to see how the compiler\\'s approach changes based on the length of the comparison.</p>\\n\\n<p>As we learned when looking at <a href=\"https://xania.org/202512/16-calling-conventions\">calling conventions</a>, a <code>std::string_view</code> is a pointer and a length, passed in two registers on x86 Linux. Each of these functions receives a <code>std::size_t</code> length in <code>rdi</code> and a <code>const char *</code> pointer in <code>rsi</code><sup id=\"fnref:yes\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://xania.org/feed#fn:yes\">2</a></sup>. One might reasonably expect a call to <code>memcmp</code>, but the compiler has both <a href=\"https://xania.org/202512/17-inlining-the-ultimate-optimisation\">inlined</a> and specialised the comparison for each constant string. Let\\'s take a look at some of these comparison functions, starting with <code>t1</code>:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nl\">t1:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">cmp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">rdi</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"c1\">; is length 1?</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">jne</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">.LBB0_1</span><span class=\"w\">               </span><span class=\"c1\">; if not 1, goto \"return false\"</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">cmp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">byte</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ptr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"no\">rsi</span><span class=\"p\">],</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">65</span><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">; is the byte 65 (\\'A\\')?</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">sete</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">al</span><span class=\"w\">                   </span><span class=\"c1\">; set result to 0 or 1 accordingly</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">ret</span><span class=\"w\">                       </span><span class=\"c1\">; return</span>\\n<span class=\"nl\">.LBB0_1:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">xor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">eax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">eax</span><span class=\"w\">              </span><span class=\"c1\">; set result to false</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">ret</span><span class=\"w\">                       </span><span class=\"c1\">; return</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>We see the length is checked first, and if it\\'s not 1, then we return. Otherwise, we check the one character to see if it\\'s <code>A</code> or not, and then set the return value accordingly. The compiler has used a conditional set <code>sete</code> instruction to avoid a second branch.</p>\\n\\n<p>The pattern holds for power-of-two sizes: Looking at <code>t2</code>, <code>t4</code> and <code>t8</code> we see that the compiler does the same length check, and then cleverly realises it can compare a 2, 4 or 8-byte value directly with a constant of either <code>AB</code>, <code>ABCD</code> or <code>ABCDEFGH</code> (mouse over the constants in the view to see Compiler Explorer interpret them as ASCII).</p>\\n\\n<p>Things get more interesting with the 7 character case, <code>t7</code>:</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nl\">t7:</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">cmp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">rdi</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"w\">                    </span><span class=\"c1\">; is length 7?</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">jne</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">.LBB6_1</span><span class=\"w\">                   </span><span class=\"c1\">; if not, goto \"return false\"</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">mov</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">eax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1145258561</span><span class=\"w\">           </span><span class=\"c1\">; set eax to \"ABCD\"</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">xor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">eax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">dword</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ptr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"no\">rsi</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"c1\">; eax ^= first four chars of sv</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">mov</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ecx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1195787588</span><span class=\"w\">           </span><span class=\"c1\">; set ecx to \"DEFG\"</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">xor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ecx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">dword</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ptr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"no\">rsi</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">; ecx ^= chars 3,4,5,6 of sv</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">or</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">ecx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">eax</span><span class=\"w\">                   </span><span class=\"c1\">; ecx |= eax</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">sete</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"no\">al</span><span class=\"w\">                       </span><span class=\"c1\">; result = 1 if \"zero flag\" else 0</span>\\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nf\">ret</span><span class=\"w\">                           </span><span class=\"c1\">; return</span>\\n</code></pre></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>The check for the length is the same as the other cases, but once we know we\\'re going to be comparing 7 bytes, some cunning tricks come into play. First, the compiler isn\\'t directly comparing, as you might expect: It uses the fact that XORing identical values will result in a zero. Secondly, it has used two <em>overlapping</em> reads - reading bytes 0,1,2,3 and then 3,4,5,6. The redundant read of byte 3 doesn\\'t matter, but doing two 32-bit reads is cheaper than having to read individual bytes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once the two XORs have happened, we have \"zero only if first four bytes match ABCD\" in <code>eax</code> and \"zero only if bytes 3,4,5,6 match DEFG\" in <code>ecx</code>. Simply logical-ORing the two together gives us zero if and only if both were zero - only if all bytes matched. Then a simple <code>sete</code> turns the \"zero flag\" into either 0 or 1 for the <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> return value needed. Cute!</p>\\n\\n<p>This optimisation works well on x86 as reading unaligned 32-bit values is free. You can play around with the compiler choice and see what neat tricks are conjured up by different compilers and architecture choices.</p>\\n\\n<p>And that\\'s what makes modern compilers remarkable - all this cleverness is conjured up from a simple <code>sv == \"ABCDEFG\"sv</code>. The overlapping reads, the XOR operations, the branchless conditionals - they\\'re all applied automatically. Your job is to write clear code; the compiler\\'s job is to make it fast. Leave it to do its thing, and try not to get in its way!</p>\\n\\n<p><em>See <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kXmqwJoaapg\">the video</a> that accompanies this post.</em></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p><em>This post is day 22 of <a href=\"https://xania.org/AoCO2025-archive\">Advent of Compiler Optimisations 2025</a>,\\na 25-day series exploring how compilers transform our code.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>← <a href=\"https://xania.org/202512/21-vectorising-floats\">When SIMD Fails: Floating Point Associativity</a> | <a href=\"https://xania.org/202512/23-switching-it-up\">Switching it up a bit</a> →</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>This post was written by a human (<a href=\"https://xania.org/MattGodbolt\">Matt Godbolt</a>) and reviewed and proof-read by LLMs and humans.</em></p>\\n\\n<p><em>Support Compiler Explorer on <a href=\"https://patreon.com/c/mattgodbolt\">Patreon</a>\\nor <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/compiler-explorer\">GitHub</a>,\\nor by buying CE products in the <a href=\"https://shop.compiler-explorer.com\">Compiler Explorer Shop</a></em>.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"footnote\">\\n<hr />\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\"fn:gcc\">\\n<p>GCC generates more obvious, but slightly worse code, with some unnecessary logic operations.

(For the uninitiated: Think of it kind of like swiping between virtual desktops on Windows or MacOS, except you can do it on every single window, slideshow-style.) It was the best of both worlds—easy to navigate, while remaining mousable.</p><p>Eventually more people figured out that this was the ticket, and now PaperWM has grown from quiet experiment to robust extension. As a way to prove an idea, it was basically flawless, to the point where <a href=\"https://github.com/mogenson/PaperWM.spoon\">someone made a MacOS version</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"PaperWM.jpg\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/0C0qYpwP8n_eHZLfMLztidHSRWE=/2560x1440/filters:quality(80)/uploads/PaperWM.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /><figcaption>A screenshot of PaperWM, quietly one of the most exciting interface innovations of the past decade.</figcaption></figure><p>But it had a problem: It was attached to <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org\">GNOME</a>, with all the extra cruft that implies. GNOME’s interface has a lot of fans (me included), but it’s mature, complex, and prescriptive. It’s controversial in the Linux world because it makes UX decisions for users that sometimes get in the way of user choice. I tend to defend it, but if you were to put “heavy FOSS graphical interface” in the dictionary, GNOME would most assuredly show up.</p><p>Retrofitting a new user interface paradigm on top of that dynamic comes with compromises.</p><figure><img alt=\"niri-star.jpg\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/vXUzMp2F9wWKgd9anr0SBeLjgLw=/1000x723/filters:quality(80)/uploads/niri-star.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>If you want to think about things in terms of GitHub stars, Hyprland is growing fast, but Niri is starting to catch up.</figcaption></figure><p>Which is why I’ve been keeping an eye on <a href=\"https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri\">niri</a>, an emerging window manager that is doing for sliding windows what <a href=\"https://hypr.land\">Hyprland</a> did for tiling. It is less than three years old (Hyprland is about four), but has quickly grown in popularity, <a href=\"https://www.star-history.com/#YaLTeR/niri&amp;hyprwm/Hyprland&amp;type=date&amp;legend=top-left\">doubling its GitHub star count</a> in the past six months.</p><p>Built around the Wayland compositor, the project basically is set up like a kit, one where you need to supply parts in the form of config files. If you like customizing, it may be the project for you. But if you just want to get stuff done, it might not feel like a welcoming experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/10/13/omarchy-linux-distro-commentary/\">Omarchy</a>, which we (controversially) covered a few months ago, exists because of this gap. People want the lightweight customizability of a window manager, but not the work of having to set it up.</p><p>To be clear, this is not far from where graphical interfaces for Linux and Unix variants started 40 years ago, but it’s arguably making a comeback because of a combination of sophisticated users and sophisticated tools. But not everyone has time to build their own config files from scratch.</p><figure><img alt=\"Niri-DankMaterialShell.jpg\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/uYXMVYlFTT5co6jvsW37CQD9dCg=/1000x625/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Niri-DankMaterialShell.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>My setup, combining Niri and the DankMaterialShell.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where the project <a href=\"https://danklinux.com\">Dank Linux</a> comes in. Pitched as a “modern desktop for Wayland,” it’s a set of “batteries included” tools to get you going in Niri or other window managers based on Wayland. Key to the project is DankMaterialShell, which combines a number of tools into one interface, along with the <a href=\"https://m3.material.io\">Material design</a> approach. If Hyprland, Sway, niri and their ilk are attempts to deconstruct the desktop environment, Dank Linux tries putting it back together again.</p><p>Rather than relying on loose tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar\">waybar</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/davatorium/rofi\">rofi</a> and bringing them together with a best-in-breed approach, DankMaterialShell comes with all the necessary tools already baked in. Plus, it’s highly extensible, and can be edited through a bunch of config files, just like all the really complicated tools. But unlike Omarchy, it’s not prescriptive—you’re not just having to work around one guy’s opinion of what your UX should look like for the rest of time. (Case in point: I don’t like borders or gaps around my windows, a typical trait of scrolling window managers. So … I just removed them.)</p><p>That’s because it’s built around <a href=\"https://quickshell.org\">Quickshell</a>, a toolkit that has become very <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/quickshell\">popular as a modding tool</a> in the Linux community.</p><p>But some of us are normies who just want something that works. Hence why DankMaterialShell is making such a splash.</p><figure><img alt=\"dankmaterialshell_setup.png\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/XfhtIuGhUBxyc8cVN_Eie_hvO64=/889x936/filters:quality(80)/uploads/dankmaterialshell_setup.png\" width=\"889\" /><figcaption>An example of the graphical interface for DankMaterialShell. It has many of the features of the GNOME setup, including the ability to arrange monitors, with a lean on UI.</figcaption></figure><p>The feature set for this software is surprisingly robust, and seems to be growing quickly. <a href=\"https://danklinux.com/blog/v1-2-release\">DMS 1.2</a>, for example, has literally dozens of new features. And despite the fact that this tool is only about six months old, it already has a screenshot tool, numerous plugins, and a robust theming system. The momentum is clearly there. (It’s not alone, either—also covering the same territory is <a href=\"https://noctalia.dev\">Noctalia</a>, which promises a more relaxed aesthetic.)</p><p>The Dank Linux team offers a couple of optional utilities—the system overview tool DGOP and the MacOS Spotlight-like file tool dsearch—that can make the experience surprisingly polished.</p><p>The one downside of this is that Dank Linux isn’t really supported on Bazzite, the very popular distro I use. But after I mentioned I was interested in that, and I did some off-label testing on my end, one of the creators of <a href=\"https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium/\">Zirconium</a>, a Dank Linux distro for Fedora, reached out. Turns out, they were already working on a “quick and dirty” image that got Bazzite working with Zirconium. (As reflected by the name, <a href=\"https://github.com/bazzirco/bazzirco\">Bazzirco</a>.) They even created a <a href=\"https://dev.bazzite.gg\">Bazzite DX</a> version for me, so I could easily access my Docker containers from the thing.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://universal-blue.org\">Universal Blue</a>, the framework upon which Bazzite is based, allows you to make your own custom builds pretty easily. You can even roll back to other versions so you can switch between different builds at will. Think it’s gonna be a GNOME day? Switch to that image.)</p><p>There were some glitches here and there—for example, I found that turning variable refresh rate on for my laptop screen caused my external monitors to drag. Plus, running a “quick and dirty” build naturally means you’re going to run into some quick-and-dirty bugs. (I ran into some audio issues while running <em>Balatro</em> on the experimental distro. Not the end of the world. I signed up for this!)</p><p>Sure, you can retrofit this—albeit with common engine-swapping issues like broken keyrings—but I think the real magic might be starting fresh with it. Load it up on a new machine, set up your config to your liking, and get sliding.</p><p>But overall, this feels like a big step forward for desktop Linux—highly flexible, highly customizable, bleeding edge, yet somewhat approachable to normal people. I would go so far as to call it dank.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><h5>Sliding Links</h5><p><strong>The Muppet Show is <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/muppet-show-revival-trailer-disney-1236482871/\">coming back</a></strong> next week as a “backdoor pilot” for a potential series.

It’s not true, but their grip is slipping.</h2><img alt=\"Minus World\" src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/tedium012226.gif\" /><div class=\"whitebox\"><p><strong>With all the panicked chatter</strong> about the OnePlus brand over the last couple of days, I have a useful anecdote to add.</p><p>And it involved a recent trip to the very T-Mobile store I first got acquainted with the OnePlus brand, which has largely treated me pretty well.</p><p>But on that day, I briefly pondered if I would be happier on a carrier plan after buying my last OnePlus phone outright. I was dismayed by my options, none of which had anything close to my OnePlus 11’s killer feature: 80-watt fast charging.</p><p>It shouldn’t have been this way. After all, I found out about these phones by going into this specific T-Mobile store about eight years ago, when the iPhones started to feel overly expensive and less flexible. Looking at my options, I wandered to the other side of the store, and there it was: The OnePlus 6t, a genuinely good phone for about half the price, minus the iPhone’s ugly forehead.</p><p>That was my introduction to Android, and it was a lasting one; I am currently on my fifth OnePlus phone, after a brief diversion to Samsung-land that honestly couldn\\'t have ended soon enough.</p><p>But when I walked in the store last month, I realized the sales staff didn’t have any idea what OnePlus was when I said I wished they still sold them. Instead, the salesperson acted like I was crazy talking about this brand.</p><p>I wasn’t. They used to sell this brand, with its fast charging and unique features catching the eye. (For my money, the pop-up selfie camera, a highlight of the OnePlus 7, was the best feature a mainstream phone ever had.)</p><p>The manager knew what this brand was, but he told his employee that OnePlus had gone out of business. I had to correct him.</p><p>About two weeks later, I bought another OnePlus phone the inconvenient way—off of Amazon. It may be my favorite OnePlus phone ever. And yet, it may be my last, and not by choice.</p><p>Earlier this week, a story emerged from an Android blog that suggested OnePlus may be at risk of going away entirely. <a href=\"https://androidheadlines.com/exclusive-oneplus-collapse\">The <em>Android Headlines</em> story</a>, with the brutal headline “OnePlus is Being Dismantled,” was not based on anything firm. No informants in factories like the Apple rumor hound Ming-Chi Kuo, or solid sourcing, along the lines of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. It was more hunch-based.</p><p>The piece was packed with numerous words hinting that the company had contracted significantly, canceled some product launches, and was failing even in its strongholds. It was not an airtight piece, and people quickly picked up on the odd wording scattered throughout, leading to this message from site founder Chris Yackulic:</p><blockquote><p>As the site owner, I made the decision to use AI assistance in structuring this article. Everything else is human work, including the entire investigation, reporting from independent sources, current &amp; former employees, Chinese business publications research, and four analyst firms.</p></blockquote><p>If you have something as shocking as “a popular smartphone brand is going under,” no matter the quality of the sourcing, you don’t hand the football to the bots. That’s a piece you write yourself.</p><figure><img alt=\"AndroidHeadlines.jpg\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/80mx1DuISG7WnILfH5xnv0crHKc=/619x674/filters:quality(80)/uploads/AndroidHeadlines.jpg\" width=\"619\" /><figcaption>The Android Headlines piece that started this mess has a different author from the currently published version because it came out after it was published that the site’s owner wrote the piece with the help of AI.</figcaption></figure><h3>Truth vs. slop</h3><p>As you might imagine, OnePlus was quick to refute this commentary, with OnePlus India’s CEO, Robin Liu, <a href=\"https://x.com/RobinLiuOnePlus/status/2013829249690751486\">urging</a> interested parties to “verify information from official sources before sharing unsubstantiated claims.”</p><p>But the truth is that there do appear to be some challenges facing the company.</p><p>A mere two years after OnePlus disappeared from T-Mobile stores, employees that I personally spoke to did not even know that the company still was a going concern. That is a significant branding problem that appears to be of OnePlus’ own making. The company’s Nord line of phones was <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/analyst-oneplus-nord-phones-blowing-up-at-metro-by-t-mobile\">doing very well</a> at the lower end of the U.S. market thanks to the T-Mobile deal. But clearly, something was off. The OnePlus 11, a pretty good phone, was <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-oneplus-11-will-not-be-sold-at-t-mobile/\">kept away from the same markets</a> where the Nord line was thriving.</p><p>“We’re also looking forward to bringing more exciting products to the market through T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile in the future,” the company’s Spencer Blank <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-oneplus-11-will-not-be-sold-at-t-mobile/\">told <em>CNET</em></a> at the time.</p><p>Three years later, it’s as if OnePlus was never there. They’re now a rarity in North American brick-and-mortar retail. Based on a quick check, the only major carrier that still offers a OnePlus phone on a carrier plan is Verizon, which sells the low-end OnePlus Nord 30 5G, a three-year-old device. You can find their phones in Best Buy, but there are way more carrier stores than Best Buys.</p><p>And it’s not a problem unique to the U.S.—<a href=\"https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/devices/retailers-flag-woes-around-oneplus-offline-retail-moves/107648176\">retailers in India have complained</a> of their challenges keeping OnePlus devices in stock, despite a gray market that seems flooded with the devices.</p><p>All of this, plus a couple of other things, has made buying new OnePlus devices frustrating in recent years. The OnePlus 13, when it first came out, did not appear on Amazon for months, meaning that anyone who wanted this phone had to buy it directly from the manufacturer, losing out on easy subsidies and credit plans. (To their credit, it did eventually appear, and the OnePlus 15 did start selling on Amazon within about a month of its release.)</p><p>There’s exclusivity, and then there’s leaving customers out in the cold.</p></div><div class=\"adlayout ad-patreon\"><div class=\"md:grid md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 items-start gap-8\"><div class=\"md:col-span-1 max-w-[300px]\"><a class=\"block hover:no-underline\" href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\"><img alt=\"… You?\" class=\"w-full h-auto max-w-[300px] m-0\" src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/kofi_logo.png\" /></a></div><div class=\"md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3\"><h5 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\"><a class=\"block hover:no-underline\" href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\"> Sponsored By … You? </a></h5><div class=\"adcopy !max-w-none\"><p><strong>If you find weird or unusual topics</strong> like this super-fascinating, the best way to tell us is to <strong><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\">give us a nod on Ko-Fi</a></strong>.

Let’s hope not</h3><p>Oxygen Updater, a community of OnePlus enthusiasts that makes a third-party software installer for the phones, suggested that the energy was <a href=\"https://oxygenupdater.com/article/552/\">slowly dissipating from their community</a>, something they would obviously have a front row seat to:</p><blockquote><p>In fact, even we, at Oxygen Updater, felt the decline of OnePlus first-hand. Many years ago, despite having far fewer users, we received many more emails and messages on our own Discord server. Everyone was active and involved, and most of all, passionate. Even the quality of emails/messages has reduced over the years. It wasn’t uncommon to have a mini-conversation with someone new on a regular basis: they had suggestions for us, and we had help for them. There were even purchase advice discussions happening on the regular, with a steady flow of newcomers who were happy to be there.</p><p>Fast forward a few years, and that’s nowhere to be found; at least, not the same frequency. There are still some active members of our community, but where’s everyone else gone? If the old guards have left, where are the new replacements? I, along with long-time team member Anonymoussaurus, once considered writing an article solely to deal with this issue: to ask you all why the quality and the quantity of interactions between us and our users reduced. But we never got around to it, because we both thought that it would be a temporary thing, and that it would fix itself.</p></blockquote><p>The phones themselves seem to suggest a retreat of sorts. When I got my OnePlus phone, I opted for the 13 because it was the same design language that I had been using since the 6t, but it was clearly the most polished version of that. It was one of the best-reviewed OnePlus phones ever. The OnePlus 15, on the other hand, seemed to bet the farm on high refresh rate and battery life over everything else—and leaned into the boxy look of recent iPhones and Samsung devices. It felt like a downgrade from genuine greatness. (Speaking of downgrades, the cameras on the OnePlus 15 are significantly worse than those on the OnePlus 13. No clue what they were thinking there.)</p><p>I’m not the only person to notice this. <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-troubles-2026-3633945/\">At <em>Android Authority</em></a>, Robert Triggs seemed surprised that OnePlus took such a step back:</p><blockquote><p>The OnePlus 13 was exactly what many of us envision the ideal OnePlus phone to be, even with the odd compromise or two. On the other hand, its successor is so stuffed with side-grades and trade-offs that it’s hard to believe it came from the same company just a few months later.</p></blockquote><p>All of this is to say that, even if the <em>Android Headlines</em> report is wrong, OnePlus has a very serious brand problem which may or may not be a byproduct of its complex corporate leadership. As one of many subsidiaries of BBK Electronics, it is in the unenviable position of constantly having to compete with its corporate siblings for attention and resources. Fellow BBK brand Oppo, a major player in China, seems to get most of the attention there, which ultimately bleeds into less exciting OnePlus products in outside markets. It feels nonsensical, and it ultimately harms the products that reach consumers.</p><p>If I was OnePlus and I wanted to actually compete outside of China, I would immediately bring back the carrier deals. They may be costly, but to have a chance in the U.S. market, you simply have to play ball. At a time when three companies seem to utterly dominate the sector—Apple, Google, and Samsung—we need more competitors, not fewer.</p><p>It would be nice if one of those companies was OnePlus.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><h5>Plus-Sized Links</h5><p><strong>This <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04064-7\">story</a> in <em>Nature</em></strong> seems to be bringing out the haters, critical of the author for using AI.

Let’s talk about the chart through the lens of its two most iconic artists.</h2><img alt=\"They Were Robbed\" src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/tedium011926.gif\" /><div class=\"whitebox\"><div class=\"big\"><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> If you’re an artist who has multiple songs on the overhang of the Hot 100, can you really be called a “hitmaker”? For much of Billboard’s history, the Hot 100 has frequently appeared with an unusual sibling chart called the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Chart, which is where songs go if they don’t quite have the juice to become mainstream pop hits. It’s not the worst place to land if you’re an artist—after all, you may be hitting a different radio format than the Hot 100 covers. But you know what has to suck? Getting stuck there over and over again. What’s that like? And who has it happened to? Today’s Tedium ponders the songs and artists that have come to a simmer, but not quite a boil. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></div></div><div class=\"redbox\"><div class=\"number\"><h3>1959</h3></div><p><strong>The first year that the Bubbling Under</strong> chart appeared next to the Hot 100, about a year after the release of the first chart. Originally featuring 15 additional songs, it was intended as a way to highlight emerging hits, which at the time, tended to blow up regionally before going national. It was a chart for potential sleeper hits. In the early years, the chart was full of songs that didn’t quite set the world ablaze. The second place song on <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=CiAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43\">the original June 1, 1959, chart</a>, The Eternals’ “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLHLxYkBDc\">Rockin’ in the Jungle</a>,” is an excellent example of this challenge in action. The song appeared on the Bubbling Under chart for a couple of weeks, then on the lower reaches of the Hot 100 for a few weeks, then it disappeared for good. Classic Bubbling Under chart arc.</p></div><div class=\"whitebox\"><figure><img alt=\"youngboy-never-broke-again.jpg\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/a-PkY1hN5tCFqcRYKvm1Gf9Sovo=/1000x667/filters:quality(80)/uploads/youngboy-never-broke-again.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>YoungBoy Never Broke Again releases so many songs on a regular basis that he recently set a RIAA certification record essentially through saturation. (Motown Records)</figcaption></figure><h3>Why YoungBoy Never Broke Again is the quintessential modern Bubbling Under artist</h3><p><strong>The best way to discuss</strong> the Bubbling Under phenomenon is to first explain it in very 2026 terms, rather than starting at the beginning and hitting the modern day. Nowadays, the way that songs seem to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 seems to essentially follow a couple of key methods:</p><ul><li><strong>The traditional method</strong>—lots of radio play and label marketing. “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPa7bsKwL-c\">Die With A Smile</a>” by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars is a great recent example of this.</li><li><strong>A song returns to the charts,</strong> or makes its debut very late, thanks to its appearance on TikTok or in a popular TV show. She &amp; Him’s belated top 40 appearance, 2008’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyGU-UudvrM\">I Thought I Saw Your Face Today</a>,” exemplifies this.</li><li><strong>Virality sweeps up a new artist,</strong> whether planned or unplanned. This is the model <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7bQwwqW-Hc\">Shaboozey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ah9tWTkmk\">Alex Warren</a> used to climb the mountain.</li><li><strong>An artist with a huge following</strong> releases an album, and most of its songs chart because fans are listening in droves.</li></ul><p>The last descriptor applies very much to Taylor Swift and a few other massive artists, but it also describes Youngboy Never Broke Again, an excellent example of someone who releases a <em>lot</em> of music. Recently, news hit that NBA YoungBoy, as he’s also called, <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/a/treyalston/youngboy-never-broke-again-riaa-singles-ever\">had more RIAA certifications</a> than any other rapper ever, with 126 separate certifications since his 2017 debut. (By the way, he’s 28 years old, and has spent a major portion of his time in the spotlight in prison or on house arrest. Talk about speedrunning life.)</p><p>The number of certifications, on top of his nine platinum albums, reflect the fact that anytime he releases an album or mixtape, both it and its songs tend to chart. He has charted 106 songs on the Billboard Hot 100—but he has charted <em>109</em> <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/artist/youngboy-never-broke-again/chart-history/hsi/\">on the Bubbling Under list</a>. He has only had one top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 (the 6x platinum “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw5fNI400E4\">Bandit</a>,” a 2019 joint collab with the late Juice WRLD, who died the year it was released), but 13 number-one hits on the Bubbling Under list.</p><p>Basically, Youngboy Never Broke Again floods the zone so aggressively that he can be impossible to ignore. He’s never on top of the chart, but he’s always on it—a strategy that basically means you have to keep releasing product multiple times per year. He doesn’t give listeners time to miss him, and rather than saturating the market, the market has effectively proven the savvy of this over-release strategy.</p><p>Youngboy fully admits he has a problem with pacing. <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/youngboy-nba-music-releases-disease-1235209849/\">As he told <em>Billboard</em> in 2023</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s a disease,” he shares of his ability to put out as much music as possible. “Literally, I cannot help myself. I tell myself sometimes, ‘I’m not going to drop until months from now,’ but it’s addictive. I wish I knew when I was younger how unhealthy this was for me. Whatever type of energy I had inside me, I would’ve pushed it toward something else.”</p><p>He adds, “The music is therapy, but I can’t stop it when I want,” he goes on, sounding almost ashamed. “And the lifestyle is just a big distraction from your real purpose.”</p></blockquote><p>When you release so many songs that the Wikipedia page <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YoungBoy_Never_Broke_Again_discography\">for just your discography</a> is many times longer than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1980\">the average Billboard Year-End Hot 100 chart</a>, it ensures that not all of your singles are going to be big hits.</p><p>Based on his release strategy and his young age, his record of most Bubbling Under hits is likely to keep growing.</p><p>But the thing is, being a prolific Bubbling Under artist in the Spotify era is way different from how it worked even 15 years ago. It is hard to compare them. To highlight the difference, I have to point you to the quintessential pre-digital Bubbling Under band: The Robbs.</p></div><div class=\"redbox\"><div class=\"number\"><h3>1985</h3></div><p><strong>The year that the Bubbling Under Hot 100 took a pause,</strong> disappearing in the August 31, 1985 issue and only returning in 1992. If you go to the Billboard site, the chart shows its start date as <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/bubbling-under-hot-100-singles/1992-12-05/\">December 5, 1992</a>, when a song that would become an actual legit hit would top the chart. (In case you’re wondering, Positive K’s talking-to-a-female-version-of-himself hit “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvYIpa1Ulvw\">I Got A Man</a>,” which hit the top 20. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ernie.tedium.co/post/3mcpcabymsc2j\">It was a weird song</a>!) Feel like reliving the pre-1992 history? Joel Whitburn’s <em>Bubbling Under the Hot 100, 1959-1985</em>, a 1992 book, covers the pre-modern-era-history more or less completely. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnsbub0000whit_c0c3/\">And it’s on the Internet Archive</a>.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><p><em>This song was never actually released but hit the Bubbling Under charts anyway, which raises the question—how do they tabulate these things?</em></p><h3>Five random facts about the Bubbling Under list</h3><ol><li><strong>The number of songs on the list has varied significantly over the years.</strong> While it’s been more or less consistent since 1992, the chart <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnsbub0000whit_c0c3/page/6/mode/2up\">varied between 10 tracks and 35</a> in the early years, and sometimes didn’t appear in <em>Billboard</em> at random points in the 1970s.</li><li><strong>At least one perceived lostwave track appeared on the chart.</strong> The 1979 song “Ready N’ Steady” by the artist D.A. has an interesting history. In Joel Whitburn’s <em>Bubbling Under the Hot 100, 1959-1985</em>, he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnsbub0000whit_c0c3/page/50/mode/2up?q=ready\">literally offered a cash reward</a> to anyone who had information about it. It <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/the-mystery-of-the-phantom-billboard-hit-ready-n-st-1798249641\">took until 2016</a> for someone to find it—and it turns out the song wasn’t even properly released. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdt_Aer-46Q\">You can listen to it here</a>—to my ears, it sounds like the unholy merger of Bob Seger and Lynyrd Skynyrd.</li><li><strong>Two of <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/artist/pearl-jam/chart-history/hsi/\">Pearl Jam</a>’s iconic hits bubbled under for years.</strong> “Alive” and “Even Flow” were hits just before the Bubbling Under chart made its inauspicious return in 1992, but hadn’t been released as physical singles until 1995, something the band did in response to costly imports. (They weren’t previously eligible for the Hot 100 because of a <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2022/06/08/billboard-chart-quirks-history/\">well-known chart quirk</a> that ignored album tracks.) The combination of singles’ unusual reason for existence and their well-after-the-fact release strategy kept them bubbling under for years. “Alive” put in a record 61 off-and-on weeks, and “Even Flow” 52. (“Jeremy,” released at the same time, had a shorter stay on the Bubbling Under charts because it actually hit the Hot 100.)</li><li><strong>The Village People held the most-weeks record before Pearl Jam.</strong> While better known for “Macho Man” and “Y.M.C.A.” today, the group’s 1977 debut single “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgOX9u0XMuM\">San Francisco (You’ve Got Me)</a>” put in a surprising 30 weeks on the bubbling under chart. That’s the most during the Bubbling Under chart’s original run, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnsbub0000whit_c0c3/page/358/mode/2up?q=parliament\">per Whitburn</a>. (Fun fact: Their first album was only 22 minutes long and had just four songs.)</li><li><strong>At least one bubble song made a big pop.</strong> The Kingsmen’s “Louie Louie,” a classic example of a regional hit gone national, spent 10 weeks on the Bubbling Under chart in multiple runs before hitting the Hot 100 and getting all the way #2 on the charts. If you hang out on the Bubbling Under chart for that long, you generally don’t have the juice. “Louie Louie,” perhaps thanks in part to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/31/1209181745/louie-louie-the-story-behind-the-song-everyone-knows-but-no-one-understands\">its surrounding controversy</a>, was the exception. (Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders also covered this song, a point that will become notable in a second.)</li></ol></div><div class=\"whitebox\"><figure><img alt=\"the-robbs-album.jpg\" height=\"996\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/iZ72IOMckw_rp4zOFxmLVrxJmpE=/1000x996/filters:quality(80)/uploads/the-robbs-album.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>The reason The Robbs have such big smiles on their faces is because they didn’t know at the time that they would be the quintessential Bubbling Under band.</figcaption></figure><h3>The Robbs bubbled under six times without having a single hit—but it’s what they did after that makes them notable</h3><p><strong>So, let’s say that your band</strong> was discovered by one of the most powerful people in the music industry. Your band had a record deal with a major label—and you were huge regionally, scoring a number of hits in your local market.</p><p>You even appeared on national TV, and the band you replaced was one of the biggest hitmakers of its era.</p><p>But, for whatever reason, you couldn’t quite make the leap beyond regional prowess. However, after you hung it up (after an attempted reinvention), you went behind the scenes and helped other artists score huge hits of their own.</p><p>That’s the story of The Robbs, a band that still holds the record of “most Bubbling Under Hot 100 hits without hitting the Hot 100,” 55 years after they set it. Formed in the early 1960s around the lead singer Dee Robb, the band eventually landed its primary name around 1965. (Robb, in case you’re wondering, is a stage name, like Ramone, but three of the four members were actually brothers.)</p><p>Soon, a guy named Dick Clark caught wind of them, got them a record deal, and made them the house band of his show <em>Where the Action Is</em>, a spinoff of <em>American Bandstand</em>. Early in its history, <em>Bandstand</em> appeared on television every weekday, but had been relegated to Saturday afternoons by the mid-1960s; <em>Action</em> took its place. And that meant that The Robbs got a ton of television exposure during an era when it made a huge difference.</p><p>It worked out quite well for the band they replaced on <em>Action</em>, Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders, who scored a number of top-20 hits while on the show and immediately after. (As mentioned above, Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders also recorded an early version of “Louie Louie.” They’re all over this story despite not really being prominent bubblers themselves.)</p><p>The Robbs were set up for this success themselves. After all, Dick Clark, the guy who got them their record deal, was the one talking them up on this show—as highlighted by his intro on the video for their first big almost-hit, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kfcEEd6dkU\">Race With the Wind</a>.”</p><p>The band, in vests and puffy shirts, had the look of what was popular—they sounded like The Byrds, and Dee Robb had a Rickenbacker in his hands, just like Roger McGuinn. (Though his guitar had <em>six</em> strings, not twelve.)</p><p>The songs had strong regional success, and were featured in huge profiles in their home state of Wisconsin. <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-post-crescent-the-robbs-profile/189244447/\">An example of the coverage</a> from the Appleton <em>Post-Crescent</em> in 1966:</p><blockquote><p>The singing group, one of the top in the country after 27 appearances on Dick Clark’s “Where the Action Is.” have been tugged at, run after and mobbed by fans across the country. Wednesday, after having to break a dinner date the night before when their bus “blew up”, they took time to sit down and talk with four Appleton teenagers.</p><p>In a living room, relaxed and comfortable, drinking Pepsi and munching potato chips, the Robb boys came through as intelligent and full-of-humor young men, riding the crest like real surfers, full of the adventure of their lives, loving every minute of it, but never, except as performers, taking themselves seriously.</p></blockquote><p>The piece speaks of the members, a band of brothers and a cousin, as if they were a bunch of kids, and yeah, they probably were. But it seemed like they were on track to having a pretty amazing career. However, the chart position said otherwise—in a pre-internet era, regional success of the kind that gets you long newspaper features wasn’t always enough.</p><p>“Race With the Wind” stalled at #3 on the Bubbling Under charts, a victim of regional success that didn’t translate nationally. And they would do no better than that, even after multiple tries. Between 1966 and 1971, the band had six songs appear on the Bubbling Under chart—and none got even close to “Race With the Wind” and its mediocre watermark.</p><p>By the early ’70s, the band was ready to hit the reset button. They renamed themselves Cherokee, releasing a couple more singles … that saw similar levels of success.</p><p>(Not helping: The closest thing The Robbs had to a professional rival, Paul Revere’s renamed The Raiders, scored their only chart-topping hit with a rendition of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ixwIaN7qw\">Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)</a>.” That’s right, a song whose chorus very prominently features the word “Cherokee,” the very word The Robbs chose as their new name. Talk about upstaging.)</p><p>However, if there’s one thing that stands out about Cherokee’s sound compared to their earlier songs, it‘s the production. Their final almost-hit, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItX_vYN9M5Y\">Girl, I’ve Got News For You</a>” sounds pristine, the beneficiary of top-of-the-line production smarts. While it musically matches where they started, sonically it sounds like a million bucks.</p><p>And that actually highlights where the band’s members essentially went after the whole being-stars thing didn’t work out. In 1972, three of The Robbs’ four members opened Cherokee Studios in the rural Chatsworth area of Los Angeles, a studio that grew into major prominence as major acts like Steely Dan went to use it. The Chatsworth ranch proved a temporary home, alas, because by the mid-1970s, landlord troubles forced them into a new location.</p><p>That new location, the former MGM Studios in Hollywood, put them on the fast track to running one of the most prominent studios in the world. For more than three decades, every major act you can think of from the ’70s and ’80s made a stop there. One of the first albums recorded out of the location was David Bowie’s <em>Station to Station</em>, and that was just the start. Tom Petty recorded <em>Damn the Torpedoes</em> there, Michael Jackson <em>Off the Wall</em>, and Mötley Crüe <em>Shout at the Devil</em>.</p><p>How well-regarded was it? <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/us/snplus/entertainment/2021/08/05/legendary-cherokee-studios-uplifts-next-gen-band--hvnted\">George Martin once called it</a> the best American studio. And, most notably, Ringo Starr <a href=\"https://producelikeapro.com/blog/bruce-robb-cherokee-studio/\">nearly got all four members</a> of The Beatles on a Cherokee-produced album—only for John Lennon to get assassinated weeks before his session with Ringo.</p><p>Wild stuff, and it happened with the three Robb brothers—Bruce, Joe, and Dee—at the console. They didn’t quite get the chart-toppers themselves, but because of that, they still became associated with <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/las-cherokee-studios-to-close-1320586/\">more than 300 gold and platinum records</a>—a level that NBA Youngboy will need another five years to reach, minimum.</p><p>The studio is still active today, albeit in a new location that was opened in 2011. (Wanna learn more? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhKFulisOE\">Check out the 2021 interview</a> Produce Like a Pro did with Bruce Robb.)</p><p>The Robbs didn’t bubble over, but numerous major artists that did got a little help from them. Let’s call them honorary Hot 100 members.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><p><strong>The Bubbling Under chart goes beyond Nuggets,</strong> to drop a reference to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LBQtA8\">a legendary compilation</a> literally packed with shoulda-been hits. The thing is, if you know your chart history, there may be diamonds hiding in the bottom reaches of the chart. Which means that if you’re in the samples game, the “Bubbling Under” chart is a great place to look for ideas.</p><p>In the 2010s, two relatively big hits were created from a song that never got <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=_ycEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47\">higher than #2</a> on the Bubbling Under chart. That song, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6mGHwHMB5s\">Bound</a>” by the Ponderosa Twins Plus One, became the basis for one of Kanye West’s best-regarded singles, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAtAM7vtgc\">Bound 2</a>” (which samples the chorus) and years later, Tyler, The Creator’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JQDPjpfiGw\">A Boy Is a Gun</a>” (which samples the verse).</p><p>Both songs hit the actual Hot 100. “Bound 2” hit #12, a middling performance for the controversial rapper. “Bound” was bound to the lower reaches.</p><p>Tyler, The Creator was involved in producing both songs. I can’t assume that he has a copy of Joel Whitburn’s <em>Bubbling Under the Hot 100, 1959-1985</em> hanging around, but the fact that these samples found a modern context reflects that the music might have been made for the wrong moment.</p><p>The Ponderosa Twins Plus One story didn’t end particularly great—a child group made up of a pair of twins and a non-twin lead singer, the group broke up because of lack of sales. One pair of twins died before Kanye’s song came out; the other has largely spent the last 50 years in prison. That left Ricky Spicer, the “plus one” of the equation, to fight for the <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-336-1213727\">resulting legal battle</a> from the Kanye song.</p><p>(Spicer, who has been described as the “Michael Jackson” of the group, spent much of the 2010s suing basically anyone he felt violated his copyright—<a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/54867-vogue-sued-over-bound-2-sample-in-kanye-west-and-kim-kardashians-cover-shoot-video/\">magazines</a>, <a href=\"https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2016cv00953/453259\">streaming services</a>, the list goes on.)</p><p>A vintage song that hits the Bubbling Under chart but never leaps over it is likely to have all the parts of a hit—a great chorus, a radio-friendly sound. But it’s missing that one thing to put it over the edge. Presumably artists with deep record collections can find and resurface that very thing and make a hit out of it. There is some trap artist out there that is going to find a way to turn D.A.’s “Ready ‘N’ Steady” into more than just a chart curiosity.</p><p>If the Ponderosa Twins Plus One want to take any cold comfort in this situation, it’s that the Kanye sample has helped make them far more memorable than hundreds of other “Bubbling Under” artists. It helped them bubble over.</p><p>--</p><p>Find this one an interesting read? <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2026/01/19/billboard-bubbling-under-hot-100-chart-history/\">Share it with a pal</a>!</p><p>You know what’s better than something that bubbles under?

It’s an essential part of so many parts of modern computing, including cloud infrastructure. One could draw a straight line between virtual machines, which found their footing on x86 at the turn of the 21st century, and the myriad server farms that pepper the landscape today. But it’s worth keeping in mind that it wasn’t a guarantee that this would ever happen. Intel had all but written off this concept from the server world—and seemed primed to move to a new generation of hardware that might have gotten them there. But a startup not only proved that virtualization was possible, but likely opened up a cloud-forward economy that didn’t previously exist. (It might have been a rare time when hardware was playing catch-up to software.) Today’s Tedium talks about everyone’s favorite concept, virtualization. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></div></div><div class=\"redbox\"><p><blockquote class=\"quote\"></p><h3>“For any conventional third generation computer, a virtual machine monitor may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.”</h3><p></blockquote></p><p><strong>— The first of three theorems</strong> developed by UCLA’s Gerald Popek and Honeywell’s Robert Goldberg to determine whether virtualization was possible on a particular system architecture. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/361011.361073\">Their <em>Communications of the ACM</em> piece</a>, dating to 1974, proved to be something of a Moore’s Law for virtualization in the decades afterward, a dividing line to prove what was possible. The x86 line of processors, with its CISC-y nature, violated many of the basic tenets of these theorems.</p></div><div class=\"whitebox\"><figure><img alt=\"vmware-workstation-haiku.jpg\" height=\"722\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/hiDFTX6SVca4Ms28MS-c_r5fF70=/800x722/filters:quality(80)/uploads/vmware-workstation-haiku.jpg\" width=\"800\" /><figcaption>VMware Workstation, running a version of the BeOS-inspired operating system Haiku.

A term coined by IBM that also stands for “virtual machine monitor,” it represented the idea of splitting up a computer into multiple parts that were theoretically separated from one another.</p><p>(Why “hypervisor”? Easy. The concept is essentially a reference to the supervisor above the supervisor. What, did you think it was something more futuristic than that?)</p><p>What might that look like? <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1478786.1478810\">A 1971 article</a> by IBM employee Gary Allred lays it out:</p><blockquote><p>The Hypervisor concept was relatively simple. It consisted of an addendum to the emulator program and a hardware modification on a Model 65 having a compatibility feature. The hardware modification divided the Model 65 into two partitions, each addressable from 0-n. The program addendum, having overlaid the system Program Status Words (PSW) with its own, became the interrupt handler for the entire system. After determining which partition had initiated the event causing the interrupt, control was transferred accordingly. The Hypervisor required dedicated I/O devices for each partition and, because of this, the I/O configurations were usually quite large, and, therefore, prohibitive to the majority of users.</p></blockquote><p>So, unlike a modern virtual machine, it was effectively running two machines completely separated from one another, as if they weren’t connected.</p><p>During the mainframe era, a use case like this made sense, especially given that a <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/161/565\">System/360 Model 65</a> was about the size of a vending machine.</p><p>But as we all know, computers kept getting smaller and smaller from there. First, bigger than a bread box, then smaller than a bread box, then about the size of a loaf of bread, and now about the size of bread. (Basically the bread box metaphor has been utterly destroyed by the smartphone.)</p><p>For a time, smaller computers meant smaller computing capabilities, no matter how fast the processors got. But that wasn’t necessarily the only factor at play.</p><figure><img alt=\"intel-386.jpg\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/AN_wMFde0XUFK30HTHsOKm96jrA=/800x601/filters:quality(80)/uploads/intel-386.jpg\" width=\"800\" /><figcaption>It may look like a square wafer, but it’s really a series or rings. (<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/e-coli/508518299/\">e-coli/Flickr</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Going back to <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/04/26/transmeta-crusoe-processor-history/\">our knowledge of RISC and CISC processors</a>, we know that x86 processors made by Intel and AMD tended to have a lot of instructions, which made processors overly complex. This turned out to be a problem when it came to Gerald Popek and Robert Goldberg’s set of theorems. Intel had designed the x86 chipset to run software with different levels of privilege, <a href=\"https://manybutfinite.com/post/cpu-rings-privilege-and-protection/\">set up in a series of “rings,”</a> with the goal of limiting the attack surface of the kernel.</p><p>This is good for having a secure system, but less good if your goal is to run a copy of Linux inside a copy of Windows 2000. And because the structure of this system limited access to the number of commands software could have access to, it meant you couldn’t virtualize it in quite the same way as IBM virtualized the System/360.</p><p>Sure, it was technically possible to <em>emulate</em> a Linux machine on a Windows 2000 machine, but that introduced a lot of overhead. You were recreating hardware in software—likely the very same hardware that the system already had. This didn’t make any dang sense.</p><p>Intel wasn’t alone on this front—it was really a problem with every major platform of the time, casting a broad net—but given how broadly used it was, Intel was the poster child. The x86 processor set <a href=\"https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2018/lectures/lecture25/\">violated</a> the Popek-Goldberg theorems in more than a dozen distinct ways, which seemed like it might just make VMs infeasible with the infrastructure the world currently worked on.</p><figure><img alt=\"dynamic-recompilation-patent.jpg\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/i0_LIfa-voKFJ1jjBubbySChFwY=/603x804/filters:quality(80)/uploads/dynamic-recompilation-patent.jpg\" width=\"603\" /><figcaption>A drawing from the patent filing for dynamic recompilation filed by Apple employee Eric Traut in the mid-1990s. Traut figured out how to make old Mac apps not suck on PowerPC. (<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US5790825A/en\">Google Patents</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>There were some emerging suggestions it didn’t have to be this way, though. On the Mac side of things, Apple had pulled off something of a magic trick with its transition from 68000 to PowerPC by making a translation layer that more or less ran old code natively. At first, Apple used emulation, but later switched over to something called dynamic recompilation. (<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US5790825A/en\">This technique</a> was developed by Apple employee Eric Traut, who later worked on the famed PlayStation emulator <a href=\"https://aarongiles.com/programming/war-connectix/\">Connectix Virtual Game Station</a>.) Put another way, the system was reprogramming the vintage code for MacOS to run in real time. It was so good that even in later PowerPC versions of the classic MacOS, much of the software was emulated 68k code. They didn’t need to update it, because it just worked.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Java programming language helped to popularize the concept of just-in-time compilation, which made it possible for a program to execute on a machine in real time without necessarily being tethered to its architecture. (Much of the discussion around VMs in computing magazines in the mid-’90s was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=3zsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29\">focused</a> on <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-lc5G5n5mUsC&amp;pg=PT52\">Java</a>, partly for this reason.)</p><p>JIT is arguably one of the most important techniques in modern programming—<a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/\">your web browser uses it heavily</a> to speed up its use of JavasScript—and a key element of what makes modern virtualization tick.</p><p>JIT proved that it was possible to translate applications in real time. But translating entire operating systems? The x86 was too broken to allow for anything like that.</p><p>The result was that the hypervisor, a somewhat forgotten remnant of the mainframe that had yet to overcome the Popek-Goldberg theorems that sidelined modern computers, had yet to make its big return to the mainstream. But a computer science experiment run on a top-of-the-line SGI Origin 2000 server was about to change all that.</p></div><div class=\"adlayout ad-patreon\"><div class=\"md:grid md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 items-start gap-8\"><div class=\"md:col-span-1 max-w-[300px]\"><a class=\"block hover:no-underline\" href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\"><img alt=\"… You?\" class=\"w-full h-auto max-w-[300px] m-0\" src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/kofi_logo.png\" /></a></div><div class=\"md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3\"><h5 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\"><a class=\"block hover:no-underline\" href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\"> Sponsored By … You? </a></h5><div class=\"adcopy !max-w-none\"><p><strong>If you find weird or unusual topics</strong> like this super-fascinating, the best way to tell us is to <strong><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\">give us a nod on Ko-Fi</a></strong>.

(<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zork_photo.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Five facts about virtualization you probably didn’t know</h3><ol><li><strong>The command-line success of Zork was enabled by virtualization.</strong> Infocom, the makers of the Zork series, developed a lightweight VM called <a href=\"https://www.ifwiki.org/Z-machine\">Z-machine</a> that effectively made the popular game easier to port to different devices. (This was an important strategy during this era, when computers were highly incompatible.) Rather than reprogramming the whole game on a new computer, the company developed a new compiler for each distinct system.</li><li><strong>One of the most popular game emulators is really a VM.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.scummvm.org\">ScummVM</a>, a popular tool for running games developed with the LucasArts-built game engine SCUMM, works very similarly to Z-machine, albeit with far more modernized components and an attempt to compile all those games in a reasonably modern language. It often gets mistaken for an emulator despite the fact that VM is right in the name.</li><li><strong>Hardware virtualization existed on the 386.</strong> While not quite the same thing as the hardware virtualization we use today, x86 processors starting with the 386 included a “<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/virtual-8086-mode\">virtual 8086 mode</a>,” which made it possible for 386 processors to run legacy 8086 software in a specialized mode. Applications like Desqview and Windows 3.1 took advantage of this to offer multitasking to users. This was removed for x64 processors, then brought back when Intel and AMD released their versions of hardware-level virtualization.</li><li><strong>You can run a GPU through a virtual machine.</strong> Linux’s <a href=\"https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page\">kernel-based virtual machine</a>, or KVM, technique is something of a very advanced derivative of the 1970s IBM System/360 approach, making it possible to run a VM that can directly access external hardware. That includes very high-end GPUs, which get passed through. (I used it <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/04/08/hackintosh-proxmox-vm-experience/\">to make a Hackintosh</a> one time.)</li><li><strong>Virtualization is a key technique for modernizing legacy embedded systems.</strong> It’s kind of hard to take something like an airplane and put it out of service just because the software it uses is old. But what <em>is</em> more possible is replacing the old hardware, which can be hard to repair, with more modern or modular components, but virtualizing the software on those newer systems. It’s a technique <a href=\"https://militaryembedded.com/avionics/computers/migrating-legacy-software-from-obsolete-hardware-to-modern-system-environments\">common in aircraft</a> and similarly difficult-to-replace industrial and aerospace equipment.</li></ol></div><div class=\"redbox\"><div class=\"number\"><h3>2006</h3></div><p><strong>The year that Amazon <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/\">first released</a></strong> its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) platform, which is arguably one of the most fundamental building blocks of modern cloud computing. While it didn’t use VMware’s technology, it reflected the way that VMware ultimately reshaped the computing landscape, it initially used the Xen hypervisor, which gained its superpowers thanks to virtualization hardware support. (Intel and AMD likely added that support to their processors largely in response to VMware.)</p></div><div class=\"whitebox\"><figure><img alt=\"sgi-origin-2000.jpg\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/nAqNLQWrlTPEkO_T6EdMIXNFIGI=/1000x1500/filters:quality(80)/uploads/sgi-origin-2000.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>An example of an SGI Origin 2000, like the one the founders of VMware used at Stanford.

In <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/268998.266672\"><em>Disco: Running Commodity Operating Systems on Scalable Multiprocessors</em></a>, their research paper on this work, the team spoke of sharing resources between with the host computer. From the 1997 paper:</p><blockquote><p>Disco contains many features that reduce or eliminate the problems associated with traditional virtual machine monitors. Specifically, it minimizes the overhead of virtual machines and enhances the resource sharing between virtual machines running on the same system. Disco allows the operating systems running on different virtual machines to be coupled using standard distributed systems protocols such as NFS and TCP/IP. It also allows for efficient sharing of memory and disk resources between virtual machines. The sharing support allows Disco to maintain a global buffer cache transparently shared by all the virtual machines, even when the virtual machines communicate through standard distributed protocols.</p></blockquote><p>That’s a big shift from requiring dedicated hardware for each separate machine as used in the System/360 days. But computing had the benefit of experiences like <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/02/12/remote-desktop-access-history/\">remote desktops</a> and emulators like SoftWindows and VirtualPC to show that we could virtualize the context and reuse the components.</p><figure><img alt=\"disco-paper.jpg\" height=\"925\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/9z4ZQ8-qnbWlqRl78IvpXIGjsgM=/1238x925/filters:quality(80)/uploads/disco-paper.jpg\" width=\"1238\" /><figcaption>The HTML version of the paper, as immortalized on the Internet Archive.</figcaption></figure><p>A little more about the Disco experiment: It’s rooted in Rosenblum’s work on something called SimOS, a prior initiative which Rosenblum and other researchers built on IRIX to experiment with completely simulating a computing environment through software alone. It was a project designed to help the university design a processor of its own, Flash, but it proved key to building a virtual machine and a thin OS layer, called SlimOS, to manage everything.</p><p>(Why <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2018/10/04/sgi-collector-history/\">Silicon Graphics</a>? At the time, multi-core computer processors were fairly rare, and the SGI Origin 2000 was one of the few options on the market that could handle such a task. It likely gave them enough additional headroom to do more extreme testing.)</p><figure><img alt=\"disco_chart.jpg\" height=\"777\" src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/wMLwHNzixM7XT0SDzKCmkD2RGNU=/802x777/filters:quality(80)/uploads/disco_chart.jpg\" width=\"802\" /><figcaption>The discovery that using a hypervisor in combination with just-in-time compilation caused only a very small performance decline was a huge deal. It was arguably the basis of VMware’s whole business.</figcaption></figure><p>And the testing proved the model. The overhead was fairly modest given the performance, which meant that it would theoretically be possible to use hypervisors to split up a machine into multiple pieces, each of which controlled a different process.</p><p>And, famous last words, the paper ends like this:</p><blockquote><p>This return to virtual machine monitors is driven by a current trend in computer systems. While operating systems and application programs continue to grow in size and complexity, the ma-chine-level interface has remained fairly simple. Software written to operate at this level remains simple, yet provides the necessary compatibility to leverage the large existing body of operating systems and application programs. We are interested in further exploring the use of virtual machine monitors as a way of dealing with the increasing complexity of modem computer systems.</p></blockquote><p>The paper created waves. Within a year of its creation, Bugnion, Devine, and Rosenblum would become three cofounders of VMware. Rosenblum’s wife Diane Greene, an engineer who at one point worked at SGI, would become the fourth.</p><p>Just two years after the paper’s release, VMware hit the ground running: After a year in stealth mode, VMware Workstation, a Disco adaptation for Windows and Linux, made a huge splash at the start of 1999. (One <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=51QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25\">early <em>InfoWorld</em> article</a> featured a quote from a skeptical IT advisor. Little did they know that it would come to dominate their lives.)</p><p>Decades later, the researchers <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/2382553.2382554\">created a follow-up paper</a> explaining their process for developing the original version of VMware workstation. The paper, which came years after the founders had left the company, explained that the x86’s convoluted instruction set and the diverse peripheral ecosystem created significant added complexities. (Yes, they knew that the theorems would make what they were trying to do difficult.)</p><p>But so too, did the operating systems, which they had to implement one at a time. Linux was easy. Windows was hard. OS/2 was impossible.</p><p>As the authors wrote, IBM’s failed attempt to compete with Microsoft was just too proprietary to be feasible:</p><blockquote><p>Although our VMM did not depend on any internal semantics or interfaces of its guest operating systems, it depended heavily on understanding the ways they configured the hardware. Case-in-point: we considered supporting OS/2, a legacy operating system from IBM. However, OS/2 made extensive use of many features of the x86 architecture that we never encountered with other guest operating systems. Furthermore, the way in which these features were used made it particularly hard to virtualize. Ultimately, although we invested a significant amount of time in OS/2-specific optimizations, we ended up abandoning the effort.</p></blockquote><p>All that work to develop hardware drivers and manage edge cases—and even create some fake virtual hardware that only existed in software—took time, but it paid off in a big way. The self-funded company quickly found itself making $5 million in a matter of months.</p><p><em>A user dives into the first version of VMware Workstation.</em></p><p>The software, at first, went relatively mainstream, given what it was. <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/usa-today-vmware-profile-1999/188755646/\">In a 1999 profile with <em>USA Today</em></a>, Greene (the company’s CEO) noted that the company was getting email from Buddhist monks who were fighting with one another over whether to run Linux on their computer or Windows. VMware allowed them to split the difference.</p><p>“When we first put together the business plan for VMware in 1998, we never thought Buddhist monks in Thailand would be part of our customer base,” Greene told the newspaper. “But it’s certainly intriguing to be this global.”</p><p>Of course, monks were only the start of it—if you follow VMware today, you are likely aware that Workstation is only a very small part of what that company became. VMs were highly usable in thousands of ways, as a mechanism for security and upkeep. (Want to put your custom intranet app on thousands of employee phones while still keeping it separate from those phones? Put it in a VM!)</p><p>Within a decade, Greene and Rosenblum had taken the company public, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/emc-acquires-server-specialist-vmware/\">then sold it for more than $600 million</a>. Two decades later, after a series of mergers and spinouts, it sold for a hundred times that. (More on that merger in a second.)</p><p>And this was largely before we had any of the niceties of the modern VM experience—or before VMware had much in the way of competition. Intel and AMD had not included native virtualization hardware on their chipsets until the mid-2000s. Meanwhile, Microsoft had to settle for <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/2003/02/19/microsoft-acquires-connectix-virtual-machine-technology/\">acquiring Connectix</a>, the only real competitor in the virtualization space, in 2003.</p><p>Parallels, the most popular virtualization app on the Mac, didn’t emerge until 2006, while open-source virtualization standbys like Xen, QEMU, VirtualBox, and Proxmox didn’t start making themselves known until the mid-2000s.</p><p>Put another way, VMware had a multi-year head start to dominate the world of virtualization. And in many ways, that reflects why the company has been such a key part of the enterprise for so long.</p><p>I imagine this is kind of a spicy take, but I think VMware’s success probably played a factor in x86 sticking around, despite Intel attempting to build a new generation of chip on a different architecture, called Itanium. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/itanium-a-cautionary-tale/\">Intel spent billions of dollars</a> trying to make fetch happen, only for one company to awkwardly “fetch” it: Hewlett-Packard.</p><p>After all, VMware essentially proved that with an innovative use of hypervisors, you could work around the pain points that made x86 a weak option for virtualization—and it didn’t even have to break Intel’s security model to do so! If the existing x86 architecture was this capable, why switch?</p><p>VMware’s big innovation might have been born on an SGI computer, but it really proved a saving grace for Moore’s law.</p></div><div class=\"redbox\"><div class=\"number\"><h3>2011</h3></div><p><strong>The year that Diebold,</strong> a major manufacturer of ATMs (and yes, voting machines), announced “the world’s first virtualized ATM.” It was a prototype that ultimately separated the software of an ATM, which can be quite difficult to update in the field, from the hardware. The concept, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diebold-to-unveil-prototype-for-worlds-first-virtualized-atm-128584333.html\">developed with VMware</a>, points at the way that VMs made embedded systems, especially based on outdated software, easier to manage. These days, we don’t necessarily run our ATMs on VMs, but the technique is highly popular for <em>testing</em> ATM software.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><p><strong>It’s worth noting that VMware,</strong> despite its fundamental role in modern tech as a pivotal enterprise firm that literally created an entire product category, has seen better days. Over the last couple of years, it <a href=\"https://www.broadcom.com/info/vmware\">was acquired by Broadcom</a>, a company that has aggressively reset the model to maximize profitability and move away from one-time licenses.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/broadcom-vmware-acquistion-vcf-private-cloud/733800/\">As <em>CIO Dive</em> put it</a> in 2024:</p><blockquote><p>The transition marked a seismic shift in enterprise IT. Sure, generative AI has caused its fair share of disruption, but the technology has yet to scale. The acquisition of VMware, however, and the ensuing licensing changes has threatened to upend core infrastructure, disrupt critical business processes and wreak havoc on spending.</p></blockquote><p>And just this past week, a very high-profile zero-day security exploit involving its EXSi software package <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vmware-esxi-zero-days-likely-exploited-a-year-before-disclosure/\">was exploited in the wild</a>.</p><p>VMware’s founders left nearly two decades ago, and upon Dell’s 2016 acquisition of the company, the entire team that worked on the flagship Workstation product was fired. (Which, honestly, suggests that Workstation isn’t where the real money is.)</p><p>Options for virtualization and separation of concerns abound. Whole empires have been made around tools like QEMU, and software like Docker and Podman have helped to make virtualized tools a part of many workflows.</p><p>Recently, Broadcam <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/vmware-is-suddenly-offering-a-free-hypervisor-once-again\">began to offer VMware Workstation</a>, the program that started it all, for free. Broadcom’s messaging has been all over the place—previously, the company <em>removed</em> free versions of the software. But at a time when you can virtualize operating systems on modern hardware in a couple dozen ways, Workstation (and its Mac counterpart, Fusion) are no longer groundbreaking.</p><p>Yes, VMware broke the ground, but many companies built on that foundation, and our modern digital economy is built on nesting dolls of virtual machines. Broadcom might as well turn the iconic tool, the one allowed monks to share a computer and Fortune 500 companies to modernize their aging hardware stacks, into a loss-leader.</p><p>VMware got acquired for over $60 billion for a reason. It reflects the inherent value of its original idea: We are better off with a few computers that run many machines simultaneously than many computers that only run a handful of tools.</p><p>But perhaps what the computing industry didn\\'t anticipate was that virtualization just raised demand for computers in general.</p><p>--</p><p>Find this one an interesting read? <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2026/01/12/vmware-virtualization-history/\">Share it with a pal</a>!</p><p>By the way, you know a machine that doesn’t need virtualization?

(To give you an idea, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/01/02/tedium-trends-2025/\">here’s last year’s</a>.) This covers a lot of ground in a very broken-up format. Hope you dig!</div><div class=\"big\"><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> In 2017, Google corporate parent Alphabet founded a holding company called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/google-parent-alphabet-forms-holding-company-xxvi-to-complete-2015-corporate-reorganization/\">XXVI Holdings</a>, named for the number of letters in the alphabet. (26, for those playing at home.) The goal of the company was to better separate the different companies from one another—meaning that, in a corporate sense, Google is distinct, from, say, Waymo. The ultimate end-user-facing result of this subtle change is that, if you receive a 1099 tax form for revenue received from a Google-owned platform, you’re likely getting it from this seemingly obscure company. But, here’s the spoiler alert: It’s actually from the most common company in the world. It sort of points out the prevalence of 26 as a number in our lives. While Google is the clean, front-facing version of this giant company that is all over you phone (even if you’re an iPhone user), it’s the number 26 doing the dirty work. The number 26 is behind the scenes, but in 2026, it’s gonna be everywhere. And, as today’s Tedium highlights, everyone is going to be holding XXVI this year. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></div></div><div class=\"redbox\"><p><blockquote class=\"quote\"></p><h3>“For obvious reasons, tₒ shall be called ‘doomsday,’ since it is on that date, t = tₒ, that N goes to infinity and that the clever population annihilates itself.”</h3><p></blockquote></p><p><strong>— A passage from “Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026,”</strong> an article published by Heinz von Foerster in 1960. Unlike most predictions about the end of the world, von Foerster, considered a key early figure in cybernetics, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.132.3436.1291\">made his prediction in <em>Science</em></a>, the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. (He and his colleagues also developed an equation for it, which one guesses his doomsday-predicting peers did not.) One silver lining, per von Foerster? We have control over the outcome. “Since today man’s environment becomes less and less influenced by ‘natural forces’ and is more and more defined by social forces determined by man, he himself can take control over his fate in this matter, as well as he has done in almost all areas of life where the activity of the individual has influenced his own kind,” he writes.

The result is that corn tortillas, a staple food of Mexican cuisine, are going to be healthier for infants in particular.</li><li><strong>A bunch more stuff is hitting the public domain.</strong> Books from Langston Hughes and William Faulkner are now public domain in the United States. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., works from a number of figures who died in 1955—most notably Albert Einstein and Charlie Parker—are also getting the public domain treatment, <a href=\"https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/\">per the Public Domain Review</a>.</li><li><strong>Peace out, tiny shampoo bottles.</strong> One key part of business travel is the tiny toiletries that come in every single hotel room ever. But that’s starting to change, especially in Illinois, considered one of the hubs of event travel. A law <a href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/illinois/law-banning-little-shampoo-bottles-in-illinois-hotels-goes-into-effect-tuesday-what-does-this-mean-for-guests/\">banning tiny shampoo bottles in the state’s hotels</a> took effect this week. (They join Washington, New York, and California.) You can’t take the bottles home, but the dispensers are more environmentally friendly anyway.</li><li><strong>Utah’s ID checks are about to get even tougher.</strong> I’ve only been to Utah once, and when I went, I remember getting a lot of grief for leaving my ID in my hotel room and then attempting to order a beer somewhere. The state, known for having a lot of teetotalers, is further tightening its grip, <a href=\"https://www.fox13now.com/good-day-utah/new-utah-alcohol-laws-take-effect-january-1-heres-whats-changing\">requiring 100% ID checks</a> and adding a big red “no alcohol sale” message on the drivers’ licenses of people with extreme DUI convictions. (Oh yeah, if you want to be banned from buying alcohol, you can just ask for an ID with that restriction. Nothing like a little state-sponsored self-control.)</li><li><strong>We’re finally getting a little closer to the moon.</strong> After taking a multi-decade break from moon travel, NASA is sending astronauts within shouting distance of it for the first crewed mission in more than 50 years. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-astronauts-fly-around-moon-artemis-ii-mission-2026-rcna250540\">The Artemis II mission</a>, expected to launch as soon as next month, will have astronauts getting close to the moon, but not landing on it.

Political violence crept up, and it was painful whether or not their politics were your politics. A governor nearly had his mansion burned down while he was inside of it. And the flare-ups of the current political moment certainly feel like they’re not going away just because we changed the page on the calendar.</p><p>But I think there’s something a bit less dramatic and a bit more matter-of-fact going on. We are about 40 years from the peak of the monoculture, before television had yet to split into hundreds of cable channels, before computers and smartphones let us find our own tribes and self-select around our very specific hobbies.</p><p>And because of that distance, the truth is that we’re going to lose more important people in quick succession, whether we like it or not.</p><p>I was reminded of this when I was looking back at my coverage earlier this year for our year-end pieces. I had almost forgotten that we lost Biff Wiff, the oddball character actor that became a late-in-life favorite of <em>I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson</em>, at the beginning of the year. (To be fair, there was an absolute avalanche of news around that time.)</p><p>But I was also reminded of this in a more visceral way. I was in a store, shopping for hiking boots (hoping to take part in a first-day hike), when I got an email informing me that <a href=\"https://computerchronicles.blog/post/stewart-cheifet-1938-2025/\">Stewart Cheifet had just died</a>. This hit me harder than most.</p><p>For those not familiar, Cheifet is one of the most important journalists in the history of technology, because of two important things he did: First, he created and hosted <em>Computer Chronicles</em>, a nationally syndicated television show highlighting important technology trends. (It was on PBS, the natural home for such a show.) And second, once the show ended, he went out of his way to ensure that the show got properly archived, working closely with the Internet Archive to solve that problem.</p><p>He essentially gave many formative technology trends some of their only television exposure. (As I noted in <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/02/17/access-bus-i2c-usb-competitor-history/\">a February 2025 piece about technology</a>, Cheifet gave the topic of my story, ACCESS.bus, some of the only video-based coverage around.) But is also reflected the sheer challenge of the monoculture at this time. When he started around 1983, we were many years away from having a network like TechTV or G4. (Linus Tech Tips? Hah, Linus Sebastian wasn’t even born yet.) For most viewers, if you cared about computers and wanted to watch a show about it, this was it.</p><p>And by taking the time to archive it, he essentially created the window through which so much of our understanding of tech history flows. Like it or not, we live in a visual medium. As great as it is to have a John C. Dvorak column or a 6,000-word feature about a tech concept, having Cheifet talk about that same concept on a screen is a lot more impactful to digital culture.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://obits.goldsteinsfuneral.com/stewart-cheifet\">Cheifet’s obit</a> was posted on Hacker News on Wednesday, some people described falling asleep to marathons of Cheifet’s old videos (many of which were done with <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/blog/in-his-own-words-gary-kildall/\">Gary Kildall</a>, himself a stone-cold tech legend). He represented the bridge between the monoculture of tech and the microculture of tech we have now.</p><p>I will be the first to admit that Cheifet won’t hit the radar for the average person, but he is more important than he seems. The work he was doing was extremely uncommon then, but is everywhere now. Every major media outlet that presents tech in video form owes him a mountain of praise.</p><p>We are going to see more losses like his in the years ahead, and they’re going to come from a moment where these figures were dominant in culture in a way that your favorite creator could never think of. Sure, it’s just how time goes, but I think they’re going to hit harder because the people we lose are likely going to be those you watched on TV every week for 20 years, not some faded figure from another time.</p><p>The loss of Rob Reiner underlines this. He died a mere four months after creating a long-awaited sequel to his first film, <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>. People pointed out that, while his recent films have struggled to make quite the same impact, his early work has numerous quotable moments that have become cultural touchstones. Someone with a similar skill set, starting today, would struggle to reach the same heights, and not even for artistic reasons. When we live in a world of 1,000 true fans, it’s hard for one person to so effectively dominate the culture.</p><p>This year represents a decade since 2016, when we saw many extremely influential musicians die in a single year. We lost David Bowie, and Prince, and George Michael, and Leonard Cohen. (That’s only <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38262434\">the tip of the iceberg</a>, by the way.) We may be due for a similar tipping-point year like that. Our heroes of the TV monoculture era aren’t going to be with us forever.</p><p>Recently, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/12/19/chris-zolinski-remembrance/\">I wrote a piece about losing a friend</a>, and as I get older, I’m sure more of those pieces will come, and they will hurt every time. Loss is not a new thing in my life, but there’s cultural loss and personal loss. I feel like we’re a point where the cultural loss will feel personal.</p><p>And yes, it will be hard. But remember the impact it had on us.</p></div><div class=\"redbox\"><div class=\"number\"><h3>Fe</h3></div><p><strong>The atomic symbol for <a href=\"https://periodic.lanl.gov/26.shtml\">iron</a>,</strong> the 26th element of the Periodic Table.

(NewAfrica/<a href=\"https://depositphotos.com/\">DepositPhotos.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>See, it puts employers in a catch-22: They could pay slightly less money over those 27 payments and hope it doesn’t run afoul of labor law. (Or that their employees don’t notice.) Or they could simply make the extra payment, temporarily increasing their salary by a couple thousand dollars just to keep things consistent.</p><p>As Mike Fussell of the Employment Law Worldview blog writes, this is going to cause a problem for some companies that might find themselves running into legal issues or added costs, depending on how they handle this shift:</p><blockquote><p>Additionally, employers should ensure any decreases in exempt salaried employees’ biweekly wage payments do not reduce the employees’ weekly salary below the salary threshold necessary to claim an exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act—currently $684/week—or similar state wage laws (some of which have even higher weekly salary thresholds). A failure to meet such weekly salary thresholds could result in an employee losing their exempt status, making them eligible for overtime pay.</p></blockquote><p>If you ask me, paying the checks on time and correctly is a better move than changing the pay structure. (Or, you could do what some companies do instead—pay each month on the 15th and last day of the month, losing the every-other-Friday cadence but ensuring you’re not overpaying once every 11 years.)</p><div class=\"related\"><h5>The Past Of The Future</h5><p><strong>If you’d like to experience life during a previous year,</strong> check out our New Years’ pieces from prior years: <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/01/02/tedium-trends-2025/\">2025</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/12/29/tedium-trends-2024/\">2024</a><a href=\"https://tedium.co/2022/12/30/tedium-trends-2023/\">2023</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/12/31/tedium-trends-2022/\">2022</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2020/12/30/tedium-trends-2021/\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2019/12/31/tedium-trends-2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2018/12/27/tedium-trends-2019/\">2019</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2017/12/28/tedium-trends-2018/\">2018</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2016/12/29/tedium-trends-2017/\">2017</a>, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2015/12/31/tedium-trends-2016/\">2016</a>, and <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2015/01/01/tedium-time-to-drop-the-ball/\">2015</a>.</div><p>But I think this odd numerical quirk of the 2026 calendar year points to the tension that the year inherently has.

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>In case you haven’t been following the world of software development closely, it’s good to know that vibe coding — using LLM tools to assist with writing code —\\xa0can help enable many people to create apps or software that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to make. This has led to an extraordinarily rapid adoption curve amongst even experienced coders in many different disciplines within the world of coding. But there’s a very important threat posed by vibe coding that almost no one has been talking about, one that’s far more insidious and specific than just the risks and threats posted by AI or LLMs in general.</p>\\n<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p>\\n<p><em>One of the most effective uses of LLMs is in helping programmers write code</em> A huge reason VCs and tech tycoons put billions into funding LLMs was so they could undermine coders and depress wages</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Vibe coding might limit us to making simpler apps instead of the radical innovation we need to challenge Big Tech</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Start vibing</h2>\\n<p>It may be useful to start by explaining how people use LLMs to assist with writing software. My background is that I’ve helped build multiple companies focused on enabling millions of people to create with code. And I’m personally an example of one common scenario with vibe coding. Since I don’t code regularly anymore, I’ve become much slower and less efficient at even the web development tasks that I used to do professionally, which I used to be fairly competent at performing. In software development, there are usually a nearly-continuous stream of new technologies being released (like when you upgrade your phone, or your computer downloads an update to your web browser), and when those things change, developers have to update <em>their</em> skills and knowledge to stay current with the latest tools and techniques. If you’re not staying on top of things, your skillset can rapidly decay into irrelevance, and it can be hard to get back up to speed, even though you understand the fundamentals completely, and the underlying logic of <em>how</em> to write code hasn’t changed at all. It’s like knowing how to be an electrician but suddenly you have to do all your work in French, and you don’t speak French.</p>\\n<p>This is the kind of problem that LLMs are really good at helping with. Before I had this kind of coding assistant, I couldn’t do any meaningful projects within the limited amount of free time that I have available on nights and weekends to build things. Now, with the assistance of contemporary tools, I can get help with things like routine boilerplate code and obscure syntax, speeding up my work enough to focus on the fun, creative parts of coding that I love.</p>\\n<p>Even professional coders who <em>are</em> up to date on the latest technologies use these LLM tools to do things like creating scripts, which are essentially small bits of code used to automate or process common tasks. This kind of code is disposable, meaning it may only ever be run once, and it’s not exposed to the internet, so security or privacy concerns aren’t usually much of an issue. In that context, having the LLM create a utility for you can feel like being truly liberated from grunt work, something like having a robot vacuum around to sweep up the floor.</p>\\n<h2>Surfing towards serfdom</h2>\\n<p>This all sounds pretty good, right? It certainly helps explain why so many in the tech world tend to see AI much more positively than almost everyone else does; there’s a clear-cut example of people finding value from these tools in a way that feels empowering or even freeing.</p>\\n<p>But there are far darker sides to this use of AI. Let me put aside the threats and risks of AI that are true of <em>all</em> uses of the Big AI platforms, like the environmental impact, the training on content without consent, the psychological manipulation of users, the undermining of legal regulations, and other significant harms. These are all real, and profound, but I want to focus on what’s specific to using AI to help write code here, because there are negative externalities that are unique to <em>this</em> context that people haven’t discussed enough. (For more on the larger AI discussion, see &quot;<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/01/what-would-good-ai-look-like/\">What would good AI look like?</a>&quot;)</p>\\n<p>The first problem raised by vibe coding is an obvious one: the major tech investors focused on making AI good at writing code because they wanted to make coders less powerful and reduce their pay. If you go back a decade ago, nearly everyone in the world was saying “teach your kids to code” and being a software engineer was one of the highest paying, most powerful individual jobs in the history of labor. Pretty soon, coders were acting like it —\\xa0using their power to improve workplace conditions for those around them at the major tech companies, and pushing their employers to be more socially responsible. Once workers began organizing in this way, the tech tycoons who founded the big tech companies, and the board members and venture capitalists who backed them, immediately began investing billions of dollars in building these technologies that would devalue the labor of millions of coders around the world.</p>\\n<p>It worked. More than <em>half a million</em> tech workers have been laid off in America since ChatGPT was released in November 2022.</p>\\n<p>That’s <em>just</em> in the private sector, and <em>just</em> the ones tracked by <a href=\"https://layoffs.fyi\">layoffs.fyi</a>.  Software engineering job listings have <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/\">plummeted to a 5-year low</a>. This is during a period of time that nobody even describes as a recession. The same venture capitalists who funded the AI boom keep insisting that these trends are about macroeconomic abstractions like interest rates, a stark contrast to their rhetoric the rest of the time, when they insist that they are alpha males who make their own decisions based on their strong convictions and brave stances against woke culture. It is, in fact, the case that they are just greedy people who invested a ton of money into trying to put a lot of good people out of work, and they succeeded in doing so.</p>\\n<p>There is no reason why AI tools like this <em>couldn\\'t</em> be used in the way that they\\'re often described, where they increase productivity and enable workers to do more and generate more value. But instead we have the wealthiest people in the world telling the wealthiest companies in the world, while they generate record profits, to lay off workers who could be creating cool things for customers, and then blaming it on everyone but themselves.</p>\\n<h2>The past as prison</h2>\\n<p>Then there’s the second problem raised by vibe coding: You can’t make anything truly radical with it. By definition, LLMs are trained on what has come before. In addition to being already-discovered territory, existing code is buggy and broken and sloppy and, as anyone who has ever written code knows, absolutely embarrassing to look at. Worse, many of the people who are using vibe coding tools are increasingly those who <em>don’t</em> understand the code that is being generated by these systems. This means the people generating all of this newly-vibed code won’t even know when the output is insecure, or will perform poorly, or includes exploits that let others take over their system, or when it is simply incoherent nonsense that <em>looks</em> like code but doesn’t do anything.</p>\\n<p>All of those factors combine to encourage people to think of vibe coding tools as a sort of “black box” that just spits out an app <em>for</em> you. Even the giant tech companies are starting to encourage this mindset, tacitly endorsing the idea that people don’t need to know what their systems are doing under the hood. But obviously, somebody needs to know whether a system is <em>actually</em> secure. Somebody needs to know if a system is actually doing the tasks it says that it’s doing. The Big AI companies that make the most popular LLMs on the market today routinely design their products to induce emotional dependency in users by giving them positive feedback and encouragement, even when that requires generating false responses. Put more simply: they make the bot lie to you to make you feel good so you use the AI more. That’s terrible in a million ways, but one of them is that it sure does generate some bad code.</p>\\n<p>And a vibe coding tool absolutely won’t make something truly <em>new</em>. The most radical, disruptive, interesting, surprising, weird, fun innovations in technology have happened because people with a strange compulsion to do something cool had enough knowledge to get their code out into the world. The World Wide Web itself was <em>not</em> a huge technological leap over what came before — it took off because of a huge leap in <em>insight</em> into human nature and human behavior, that happened to be captured in code. The actual bits and bytes? They were mostly just plain text, much of which was in formats that had already been around for many years prior to Tim Berners-Lee assembling it all into the first web browser. That kind of surprising innovation could probably never be vibe coded, even though all of the raw materials might be scooped up by an LLM, because even if the human writing the prompt had that counterintuitive stroke of genius, the system would still be hemmed in by the constraints of the works it had been trained on. The past is a prison when you’re inventing the future.</p>\\n<p>What’s more, if you were going to use a vibe coding tool to make a truly radical new technology, do you think today’s Big AI companies would let their systems create that app? The same companies that made a platform that just put hundreds of thousands of coders out of work? The  same companies that make a platform that tells your kids to end their own lives? The same companies whose cronies in the White House are saying there should <em>never be any laws</em> reining them in? Those folks are going to help you make new tech that threatens to disrupt their power? I don’t think so.</p>\\n<h2>Putting power in people’s hands</h2>\\n<p>I’m deeply torn about what the future of LLMs for coding should be. I’ve spent decades of my life trying to make it easier for everyone to make software. I’ve seen, firsthand, the power of using AI tools to help coders — especially those new to coding —\\xa0build their confidence in being able to create something new. I love that potential, and in many ways, it’s the most positive and optimistic possibility around LLMs that I’ve seen. It’s the thing that makes me think that maybe there is a part of all the AI hype that is not pure bullshit. Especially if we can find a version of these tools that’s genuinely open source and free and has been trained on people’s code with their consent and cooperation, perhaps in collaboration with some educational institutions, I’d be delighted to see that shared with the world in a thoughtful way.</p>\\n<p>But I also have seen the majority of the working coders I know (and the <em>non</em>-working coders I know, including myself) rush to integrate the commercial coding assistants from the Big AI companies into their workflow without necessarily giving proper consideration to the long-term implications of that choice. What happens when we’ve developed our dependencies on that assistance? How will people introduce <em>new</em> technologies like new programming languages and frameworks if we all consider the LLMs to be the canonical way of writing our code, and the training models don’t know the new tech exists? How does our imagination shrink when we consider our options of what we create with code to be choosing between the outputs of the LLM rather than starting from the blank slate of our imagination? How will we build the next generation of coders skilled enough to catch the glaring errors that LLMs create in their code?</p>\\n<p>There’s never been this stark a contrast between the negatives and positives of a new technology being so tightly coupled before when it comes to enabling developers. Generally change comes to coders incrementally. Historically, there was always a (wonderful!) default skepticism to coding culture, where anything that reeked of marketing or hype was looked at with a huge amount of doubt until there was a significant amount of proof to back it up.</p>\\n<p>But in recent years, as with everything else, the culture wars have come for tech. There’s now a cohort in the coding world that has adopted a cult of personality around a handful of big tech tycoons despite the fact that these men are deeply corrosive to society. Or perhaps <em>because</em> they are. As a result, there’s a built-in constituency for any new AI tool, regardless of its negative externalities, which gives them a sense of momentum even where there may not be any.</p>\\n<p>It’s worth us examining what’s really going on, and articulating explicitly what we’re trying to enable. Who are we trying to empower? What does success look like? What do we want people to be able to build? What do we <em>not</em> want people to be able to make? What price is too high to pay? What convenience is not worth the cost?</p>\\n<h2>What tools do we choose?</h2>\\n<p>I do, still, believe deeply in the power of technology to empower people. I believe firmly that you have to understand how to create technology if you want to understand how to control it. And I still believe that we have to democratize the power to create and control technology to as many people as possible so that technology can be something people can use as a tool, rather than something that happens _to_them.</p>\\n<p>We are now in a complex phase, though, where the promise of democratizing access to creating technology is suddenly fraught in a way that it has never been before. The answer can’t possibly be that technology remains inaccessible and difficult for those outside of a privileged class, and easy for those who are already comfortable in the existing power structure.</p>\\n<p>A lot is still very uncertain, but I come back to one key question that helps me frame the discussion of what’s next: What’s the most radical app that we could build? And which tools will enable me to build it? Even if all we can do is start having a more complicated conversation about what we’re doing when we’re vibe coding, we’ll be making progress towards a more empowered future.</p>'}",

I’ve been lucky enough to get to refine and test my skills in communicating at scale for a few decades now, and the power of talking to communities is the one area where I’d most like to pass on what I’ve learned, because it’s this set of skills that can have the biggest effect on deciding whether good ideas and good work can have their greatest impact.</p>\\n<p>My own work crosses many disparate areas. Over the years, I’ve gotten to cycle between domains as distinct as building technology platforms and products for developers and creators, enabling activism and policy advocacy in service of humanist ideals, and more visible external-facing work such as public speaking or writing in various venues like magazines or on this site. (And then sometimes I dabble in my other hobbies and fun stuff like scholarship or research into areas like pop culture and media.)</p>\\n<p>What’s amazing is, in <em>every single one</em> of these wildly different areas, the exact same demands apply when trying to communicate to broad groups of people. This is true despite the broadly divergent cultural norms across all of these different disciplines. It can be a profoundly challenging, even intimidating, job to make sure a message is being communicated accurately, and in high fidelity, to everyone that you need to reach.</p>\\n<p>That vital task of communicating to a large group gets even <em>more</em> daunting when you inevitably realize that, even if you <em>were</em> to find the perfect wording or phrasing for your message, you’d still never be able to deliver your story to every single person in your target audience by yourself anyway. There will always be another person whom you’re trying to reach that you just haven’t found yet. So, is it hopeless? Is it simply impossible to effectively tell a story at scale if you don’t have massive resources?</p>\\n<p>It doesn’t have to be. We can start with one key insight about what it takes to get your most important stories out into the world. It’s a perspective that seems incredibly simple at first, but can lead to a pretty profound set of insights.</p>\\n<h2>They have to be able to talk about us <em>without us</em>.</h2>\\n<p>They have to be able to talk about us without us. What this phrase means, in its simplest form,  is that you have to tell a story so clear, so concise, so <em>memorable and evocative</em> that people can repeat it for you even after you’ve left the room. And the people who hear it need to be able to do this the <em>first time</em> they hear the story. Whether it’s the idea behind a new product, the core promise of a political campaign, or the basic takeaway from a persuasive essay (guess what the point of this one is!) —\\xa0not only do you have to explain your idea and make your case, you have to be teaching your listener how to do the same thing for themselves.</p>\\n<p>This is a tall order, to be sure. In pop music, the equivalent is writing a hit where people feel like they can sing along to the chorus by the time they get to the end of the song for the first time. Not everybody has it in them to write a hook that good, but if you do, that thing is going to become a classic. And when someone <em>else</em> has done it, you know it because it gets stuck in your head. Sometimes you end up humming it to yourself even if you didn’t want to. Your best ideas —\\xa0your most <em>vital</em> ideas —\\xa0need to rest on a messaging platform that solid.</p>\\n<p>Delivering this kind of story actually requires substance. If you’re trying to fake it, or to force a narrative out of fluff or fakery, that will very immediately become obvious. When you set out to craft a story that travels in your absence, it has to have a body if it’s going to have legs. Bullshit is slippery and smells terrible, and the first thing people want to do when you leave the room is run away from it, not carry it with them.</p>\\n<h2>The mission is the message</h2>\\n<p>There’s another challenge to making a story that can travel in your absence: your ego has to let that happen. If you make a story that is effective and compelling enough that others can tell it, then, well…. those other people are going to tell it.  Not you. They’ll do it in their own words, and in their own voices, and make it <em>theirs</em>. They may use a similar story, but in their own phrasing, so it will resonate better with their people. This is a <em>gift</em>! They are doing you a kindness, and extending you great generosity. Respond with gratitude, and be wary of anyone who balks at not getting to be the voice or the face of a message themselves. Everyone gets a turn telling the story.</p>\\n<p>Maybe the simple fact that others will be hearing a good story for the first time will draw them to it, regardless of <em>who</em> the messenger is. Sometimes people get attached to the idea that <em>they</em> have to be the one to deliver the one true message. But a core precept of “talk about us without us” is that there’s a larger mission and goal that everyone is bought into, and this demands that everyone stay aligned to their values rather than to their own personal ambitions around who tells the story.</p>\\n<p>The truth of whomever will be most <em>effective</em> is the factor used to decide who will be the person to tell the story in any context. And this is a forgiving environment, because even if someone doesn’t get to be the voice one day, they’ll get another shot, since repetition and consistency are also key parts of this strategy, thanks to the disciplined approach that it brings to communication.</p>\\n<h2>The joy of communications discipline</h2>\\n<p>At nearly every organization where I’ve been in charge of onboarding team members in the last decade or so, one of the first messages we’ve presented to our new colleagues is, “We are disciplined communicators!” It’s a message that they hopefully get to hear as a joyous declaration, and as an assertion of our shared values. I always try to explicitly instill this value into teams I work with because, first, it’s good to communicate values explicitly, but also because this is a concept that is very seldom directly stated.</p>\\n<p>It is ironic that this statement usually goes unsaid, because nearly everyone who pays attention to culture understands the vital importance of disciplined communications. Brands that are strictly consistent in their use of things like logos, type, colors, and imagery get such wildly-outsized cultural impact in exchange for relatively modest investment that it’s mind-boggling to me that more organizations don’t insist on following suit. Similarly, institutions that develop and strictly enforce a standard tone of voice and way of communicating (even if the tone itself is playful or casual) capture an incredibly valuable opportunity at minimal additional cost relative to how much everyone’s already spending on internal and external communications.</p>\\n<p>In an era where every channel is being flooded with AI-generated slop, and when most of the slop tools are woefully incapable of being consistent about anything, simply showing up with an obviously-human, obviously-consistent story is a phenomenal way of standing out. That discipline demonstrates all the best of humanity: a shared ethos, discerning taste, joyful expression, a sense of belonging, an appealing consistency. And best of all, it represents the chance to participate for yourself — because it’s a message that you now know how to repeat for yourself.</p>\\n<p>Providing messages that individuals can pick up and run with on their own is a profoundly human-centric and empowering thing to do in a moment of rising authoritarianism. When the fascists in power are shutting down prominent voices for leveling critiques that they would like to censor, and demanding control over an increasingly broad number of channels, there’s reassurance in people being empowered to tell their own stories together. Seeing stories bubble up from the grassroots in collaboration, rather than being forced down upon people from authoritarians at the top, has an emotional resonance that only strengthens the substance of whatever story you’re telling.</p>\\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\\n<p>Okay, so it sounds great: Let’s tell stories that other people want to share! Now, uh… how do we do it? There are simple principles we can follow that help shape a message or story into one that is likely to be carried forward by a community on its own.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Ground it in your values.</strong> When we began telling the story of my last company Glitch, the conventional wisdom was that we were building a developer tool, so people would describe it as an “IDE” — an “integrated development environment”, which is the normal developer jargon for the tool coders use to write their code in. We <em>never</em> described Glitch that way. From <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170504080445/https://glitch.com/\">day one</a>, we always said “Glitch is the friendly community where you\\'ll build the app of your dreams” (later, “the friendly community where everybody builds the internet”). By talking about the site as a <em>friendly community</em> instead of an <code>integrated development environment</code>, it was crystal clear what expectations and norms we were setting, and what our values were. Within a few months, even our <em>competitors</em> were describing Glitch as a “friendly community” while they were trying to talk about how they were better than us about some feature or the other. That still feels like a huge victory — even the competition was talking about us without us! Make sure your message evokes the values you want people to share with each other, either directly or indirectly.</li>\\n<li><strong>Start with the principle.</strong> This is a topic I’ve covered before, but <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2022/01/31/you-have-to-start-with-the-principle/\">you can\\'t win unless you know what you\\'re fighting for</a>. Identify concrete, specific, perhaps even <em>measurable</em> goals that are tied directly to the values that motivate your efforts. As <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/11/05/turn-the-volume-up/\">noted recently</a>, Zohran Mamdani did this masterfully when running for mayor of New York City. While the <em>values</em> were affordability and the dignity of ordinary New Yorkers, the clear, understandable, measurable principle could be something as simple as “free buses”. This is a goal that everyone can get in 5 seconds, and can explain to their neighbor <em>the first time they hear it</em>. It’s a story that travels effortlessly on its own — and that people will be able to verify very easily when it’s been delivered. That’s a perfect encapsulation of “talk about us without us”.</li>\\n<li>**Know what makes you unique.**Another way of putting this is to simply make sure that you have a sense of self-awareness. But the story you tell about your work or your movement has to be <em>specific</em>. There can’t be platitudes or generalities or vague assertions as a core part of the message, or it will never take off. One of the most common failure states for this mistake is when people lean on <em>slogans</em>. Slogans can have their use in a campaign, for reminding people about the existence of a brand, or supporting broader messaging. But very often, people think a slogan <em>is</em> a story. The problem is that, while slogans are definitely repeatable, slogans are almost definitionally too vague and broad to offer a specific and unique narrative that will resonate. There’s no point in having people share something if it doesn’t say something. I usually articulate the challenge here like this:<strong>Only say what only <em>you</em> can say.</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>Be evocative, not comprehensive.</strong> Many times, when people are passionate about a topic or a movement, the temptation they have in telling the story is to work in <em>every little detail</em> about the subject. They often think, “if I include every detail, it will persuade more people, because they’ll know that I’m an expert, or it will convince them that I’ve thought of everything!” In reality, when people are not subject matter experts on a topic, or if they’re not already intrinsically interested in that topic, hearing a bunch of extensive minutia about it will almost always leave them feeling bored, confused, intimidated, condescended-to, or some combination of all of these. Instead, pick a small subset of the most <em>emotionally gripping</em> parts of your story, the aspects that have the deepest human connection or greatest relevance and specificity to the broadest set of your audience, and focus on telling those parts of the story as passionately as possible. If you succeed in communicating that initial small subset of your story effectively, then you may <em>earn</em> the chance to tell the other more complex and nuanced details of your story.</li>\\n<li><strong>Your enemies are your friends.</strong> Very often, when people are creating messages about advocacy, they’re focused on competition or rivals. In the political realm, this can be literal opposing candidates, or the abstraction of another political party. In the corporate world, this can be (real or imagined) competitive products or companies. In many cases, these other organizations or products or competitors occupy so much more mental space in your mind, or your team’s mind, than they do in the mind of your potential audience. Some of your audience has never heard of them at all. And a <em>huge</em> part of your audience thinks of you and your biggest rival as… basically the same thing. In a business or commercial context, customers can barely keep straight the difference between you and your competition — you’re both just part of the same amorphous blob that exists as “the things that occupy that space”. Your competitor may be the only other organization in the world that’s fighting just as hard as you are to create a market for the product that you’re selling. The same is true in the political space; sometimes the biggest friction arises over the narcissism of small differences. What we can take away from these perspectives is that our stories have to focus on what distinguishes us, yes, but also on what we might have in common with those whom we might otherwise have perceived to have been aligned with the “enemy”. Those folks might not have sworn allegiance to an opposing force; they may simply have chosen another option out of convenience, and not even seen that choice as being in opposition to your story at all.</li>\\n<li><strong>Find joy in repetition.</strong> Done correctly, a disciplined, collaborative, evocative message can become a mantra for a community. There’s a pride and enthusiasm that can come from people becoming proficient in sharing their own version of the collective story. And that means enjoying when that refrain comes back around, or when a slight improvement in the core message is discovered, and everyone finds a way to refine the way they’re communicating about the narrative. A lot of times, people worry that their team will get bored if they’re “just telling the same story over and over all the time”. In reality, as a brilliant man once said, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FgP5VRp_myE\">there’s joy in repetition</a>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Don’t obsess over exact wording.</strong> This one is tricky; you might say, “but you said we have to be disciplined communicators!” And it’s true: it’s important to be disciplined. But that doesn’t mean you can’t leave room for people to put their own spin on things. Let them translate to their own languages or communities. Let them augment a general principle with a specific, personal connection. If they have their own authentic experience which will amplify a story or drive a point home, let them weave that context into the consistent narrative that’s been shared over time. As long as you’re not enabling a “telephone game” where the story starts to morph into an unrecognizable form, it’s perfectly okay to add a human touch by going slightly off script.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Share the story</h2>\\n<p>Few things are more rewarding than when you find a meaningful narrative that resonates with the world. Stories have the power to change things, to make people feel empowered, to galvanize entire communities into taking action and recognizing their own power. There’s also a quiet reward in the craft and creativity of working on a story that travels, in finding notes that resonate with others, and in challenging yourself to get far enough out of your own head to get into someone else’s heart.</p>\\n<p>I still have so much to learn about being able to tell stories effectively. I still screw it up so much of the time, and I can look back on many times when I wish I had better words at hand for moments that sorely needed them. But many of the most meaningful and rewarding moments of my life have been when I’ve gotten to be in community with others, as we were not just sharing stories together, but <em>telling</em> a united story together. It unlocks a special kind of creativity that’s a lot bigger than what any one of us can do alone.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>As I was drafting my last piece on Friday, “<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/\">They have to be able to talk about us without us</a>”, my thoughts of course went to one of the most famous slogans of the disability rights movement, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_about_us_without_us\">Nothing about us without us.</a>” I wasn’t unaware that there were similarities in the phrasing of what I wrote. But I think the topic of communicating effectively to groups, as I wrote about the other day, and ensuring that disabled people are centered in disability advocacy, are such different subjects that I didn’t want to just quickly gloss over the topic in a sidebar of a larger piece. They\\'re very distinct topics that really only share a few words in common.</p>\\n<p>One of the great joys of becoming friends with a number of really thoughtful and experienced disability rights activists over the last several years has been their incredible generosity in teaching me about so much of the culture and history of the movements that they’ve built their work upon, and one of the most powerful slogans has been that refrain of “nothing about us without us”.</p>\\n<p>Here I should start by acknowledging Alice Wong, who we recently lost, who founded the <a href=\"https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/about/\">Disability Visibility Project</a>, and a MacArthur Fellow, and a tireless and inventive advocate for everyone in the disabled community. She was one of the first people to bring me in to learning about this history and these movements, more than a decade ago. She was also a patient and thoughtful teacher, and over our many conversations over the years, she did more than anyone else in my life to truly <em>personify</em> the spirit of “nothing about us without us” by fighting to ensure that disabled people led the work to make the world accessible for all. If you have the chance, learn about her work, and <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/Alice-Wongs-Legacy\">support it</a>.</p>\\n<p>But a key inflection point in my own understanding of “nothing about us without us” came, unsurprisingly, in the context of how disabled people have been interacting with technology. I used to host a podcast called Function, and we did an episode about how inaccessible so much of contemporary technology has become, and how that kind of ruins things for everyone. (The episode is still up on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0IN2nQWUqmQnAMxNLN85WE\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/function-with-anil-dash/id1439658455?i=1000452883786\">Apple Podcasts</a>.)  We had on <a href=\"https://emilyladau.com\">Emily Ladau</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theaccessiblestall.com\">The Accessible Stall</a> podcast, <a href=\"https://alexhaagaard.com\">Alex Haagaard</a> of <a href=\"https://www.disabledlist.org\">The Disabled List</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vilissathompson.com\">Vilissa Thompson</a> of <a href=\"https://www.rampyourvoice.com\">Ramp Your Voice</a>. It’s well worth a listen, and Emily, Alex and Vilissa really do an amazing job of pointing to really specific, really evocative examples of <em>obvious</em> places where today’s tech world could be so much more useful and powerful for everyone if its creators were making just a few simple changes.</p>\\n<p>What’s striking to me now, listening to that conversation six years later, is how little has changed from the perspective of the technology world, but also how much my own lived experience has come to reflect so much of what I learned in those conversations.</p>\\n<p>Each of them was the &quot;us&quot; in the conversation, using their own personal experience, and the experience of other disabled people that they were in community with, to offer specific and personal insights that the creators of these technologies did not have. And whether it was for reasons of crass commercial opportunism — here\\'s some money you could be making! —\\xa0or simply because it was the right thing to do morally, it\\'s obvious that the people making these technologies could benefit by honoring the principle of centering these users of their products.</p>\\n<h2>Taking our turn</h2>\\n<p>I’ve had this conversation on various social media channels in a number of ways over the years, but another key part of understanding the “us” in “nothing about us without us” when it comes to disability, is that the “us” is <em>all of us</em>, in time. It\\'s very hard for many people who haven’t experienced it to understand that everyone should be accommodated and supported, because everyone is disabled; it’s only a question of when and for how long.</p>\\n<p>In contemporary society, we’re given all kinds of justifications for why we can’t support everyone’s needs, but so much of those are really grounded in simply trying to convince ourselves that a disabled person is <em>someone else</em>, an “other” who isn’t worthy or deserving of our support. I think deep down, everyone knows better. It’s just that people who don’t (yet) identify as disabled don’t really talk about it very much.</p>\\n<p>In reality, we\\'ll all be disabled. Maybe you\\'re in a moment of respite from it, or in that brief window before the truth of the inevitability of it has been revealed to you (sorry, spoiler warning!), but it\\'s true for all of us —\\xa0even when it\\'s not visible. That means all of us have to default to supporting and uplifting and empowering the people who are disabled today. This was the key lesson that I didn’t really get personally until I started listening to those who were versed in the history and culture of disability advocacy, about how the patronizing solutions were often harmful, or competing for resources with the <em>right</em> answers.</p>\\n<p>I’ve had my glimpses of this myself. Back in 2021, I had Lyme disease. I didn’t get it as bad as some, but it did leave me physically and mentally unable to function as I had been used to, for several months. I had some frame of reference for physical weakness; I could roughly compare it to a bad illness like the flu, even if it wasn’t exactly the same. But a diminished <em>mental</em> capacity was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and was profoundly unsettling, deeply challenging my sense of self. After the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2022/07/18/i-went-to-a-coffee-shop/\">incident I’d described in 2022</a>, I had a series of things to recover from physically and mentally that also presented a significant challenge, but were especially tough because so much of people’s willingness to accommodate others is based on any disability being <em>visible</em>. Anything that’s not immediately perceived at a superficial level, or legible to a stranger in a way that’s familiar to them, is generally dismissed or seen as invalid for support.</p>\\n<p>I point all of this out not to claim that I fully understand the experience of those who live with truly serious disabilities, or to act as if I know what it’s been like for those who have genuinely worked to advocate for disabled people. Instead, I think it can often be useful to show how porous the boundary is between people who <em>don’t</em> think of themselves as disabled and those who already know that they are. And of course this does <em>not</em> mean that people who aren\\'t currently disabled can speak on behalf of those who are — that\\'s the whole point of &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;! —\\xa0but rather to point out that the time to begin building your empathy and solidarity is now, not when you suddenly have the realization that you\\'re part of the community.</p>\\n<h2>Everything about us</h2>\\n<p>There’s a righteous rage that underlies the cry of “nothing about us without us”, stemming from so many attempts to address the needs of disabled people having come from those outside the community, arriving with plans that ranged from inept to evil. We’re in a moment when the authoritarians in charge in so much of the world are pushing openly-eugenicist agendas that will target disabled people first amongst the many vulnerable populations that they’ll attempt to attack. Challenging economic times like the one we’re in affect disabled people significantly harder as the job market disproportionately shrinks in opportunities for the disabled first.</p>\\n<p>So it’s going to take all of us standing in solidarity to ensure that the necessary advocacy and support are in place for what promises to be an extraordinarily difficult moment. But I take some solace and inspiration from the fact that there are so many disabled people who have provided us with the clear guidance and leadership we need to navigate this moment. And there is simple guidance we can follow when doing so to ensure that we’re centering the right leaders, by listening to those who said, “nothing about us without us.”</p>'}",

    "link": "https://anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/",
    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>The number one question I get from my friends, acquaintances, and mentees in the technology industry these days is, by far, variations on the basic theme of, “what the hell are we supposed to do now?”</p>\\n<p>There have been mass layoffs that leave more tech workers than ever looking for new roles in the worst market we’ve ever seen. Many of the most talented, thoughtful and experienced people in the industry are feeling worried, confused, and ungrounded in a field that no longer looks familiar.</p>\\n<p>If you’re outside the industry, you may be confused — isn’t there an AI boom that’s getting hundreds of billions of dollars in investments? Doesn’t that mean the tech bros are doing great? What you may have missed is that half a million tech workers have been laid off in the years since ChatGPT was released; the same attacks on marginalized workers and DEI and “woke” that the tech robber barons launched against the rest of society were aimed at their own companies first.</p>\\n<p>So the good people who actually <em>make</em> the technology we use every day, the real innovators and creators and designers, are reacting to the unprecedented disconnect between the contemporary tech industry and the fundamentals that drew so many people toward it in the first place. Many of the biggest companies have abandoned the basic principle of making technology that actually <em>works</em>. So many new products fail to deliver on even the basic capabilities that the companies are promising that they will provide.</p>\\n<p>Many leaders at these companies have run full speed towards moral and social cowardice, abandoning their employees and customers to embrace rank hatred and discrimination in ways that they pretended to be fighting against just a few years ago. Meanwhile, unchecked consolidation has left markets wildly uncompetitive, leaving consumers suffering from the effects of categories without any competition or investment — which we know now as “enshittification”. And the full-scale shift into corruption and crony capitalism means that winners in business are decided by whoever is shameless enough to offer the biggest bribes and debase themselves with the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/\">most humiliating display</a> of groveling. It’s a depressing shift for people who, earlier in their careers, often actually <em>were</em> part of inventing the future.</p>\\n<p>So where do we go from here?</p>\\n<h2>You’re not crazy.</h2>\\n<p>The first, and most important, thing to know is that <em>it’s not just you</em>. Nearly everyone in tech I have this conversation with feels very isolated about it, and they’re often embarrassed or ashamed to discuss it. They think that everyone else who has a job in tech is happy or comfortable at their current employers, or that the other people looking for work are getting calls back or are being offered interviews in response to their job applications. But I’m here to tell you: it is grim right now. About as bad as I’ve seen. And I’ve been around a long time.</p>\\n<p>Every major tech company has watched their leadership abandon principles that were once thought sacrosanct. I’ve heard more people talk about losing respect for executives they trusted, respected, even <em>admired</em> in the last year than at any time I can remember. In smaller companies and other types of organizations, the challenges have been more about the hard choices that come from dire resource constraints or being forced to make ugly ethical compromises for pragmatic reasons. The net result is tons of people who have lost pride and conviction in their work. They’re going through the motions for a paycheck, because they know it’s a tough job market out there, which is a miserable state of affairs.</p>\\n<p>The public narrative is dominated by the loud minority of dudes who are content to appease the egos of their bosses, sucking up to the worse impulses of those in charge. An industry that used to pride itself on publicly reporting security issues and openly disclosing vulnerabilities now circles its wagons to gang up on people who suggest that an AI tool shouldn’t tell children to harm themselves, that perhaps it should be possible to write a law limiting schools from deploying AI platforms that are known to tell kids to end their own lives. People in tech endure their bosses using slurs at work, making jokes about sexual assault, consorting with leaders who have directly planned the murder of journalists, engaging in open bribery in blatant violation of federal law and their own corporate training on corruption, and have to act like it’s normal.</p>\\n<p>But it’s not the end of the world. The forces of evil have not yet triumphed, and all hope is not lost. There are still things we can do.</p>\\n<h2>Taking back control</h2>\\n<p>It can be easy to feel overwhelmed at such an unprecedented time in the industry, especially when there’s so much change happening. But there are concrete actions you can take to have agency over your own career, and to insulate yourself from the bad actors and maximize your own opportunities — even if some of those bad actors are your own bosses.</p>\\n<h3>Understanding systems</h3>\\n<p>One of the most important things you can do is to be clear about your own place, and your own role, within the systems that you are part of. A major factor in the changes that bosses are trying to effect with the deployment of AI is shifting the role of workers within the systems in their organization to make them more replaceable.</p>\\n<p>If you’re a coder, and you think your job is to make really good code in a particular programming language, you might double down on getting better at the details of that language. But that’s almost certainly misunderstanding the system that your company thinks you’re part of, where the code is just a means to the end of creating a final product. In that system-centric view, the programming language, and indeed all of the code itself, doesn’t really matter; the person who is productive at causing all of that code to be created reliably and efficiently is the person who is going to be valued, or at least who is most likely to be kept around. That may not be satisfying or reassuring if you truly love coding, but at least this perspective can help you make informed decisions about whether or not that organization is going to make choices that respect the things you value.</p>\\n<p>This same way of understanding systems can apply if you’re a designer or a product manager or a HR administrator or anything else. As I’ve covered before, <a href=\"https://anildash.com/2024/05/28/systems-the-purpose-of-a-system/\">the purpose of a system is what it does</a>, and that truth can provide some hard lessons if we find it’s in tension with the things we <em>want</em> to be doing for an organization. The system may not value the things we do, or it may not value them enough; the way they phrase this to avoid having to say it directly is by describing something as “inefficient”. Then, the question you have to ask yourself is, can you care about this kind of work or this kind of program at one level higher up in the system? Can it still be meaningful to you if it’s slightly more abstract? Because that may be the requirement for navigating the expectations that technology organizations will be foisting on everyone through the language of talking about “adopting AI”.</p>\\n<h3>Understanding power</h3>\\n<p>Just as important as understanding systems is understanding <em>power</em>. In the workplace, power is something real. It means being able to control how money is spent. It means being able to make decisions. It means being able to hire people, or fire them. Power is being able to say no.</p>\\n<p>You probably don’t have enough power; that’s why you have worries. But you almost certainly have more power than you think, it’s just not as obvious how to wield it. The most essential thing to understand is that you will need to collaborate with your peers to exercise collective power for many of the most significant things you may wish to achieve.</p>\\n<p>But even at an individual level, a key way of understanding power in your workplace is to consider the systems that you are part of, and then to reckon with which ones you can meaningfully change from your current position. Very often, people will, in a moment of frustration, say “this place couldn’t run without me!” And companies will almost always go out of their way to prove someone wrong if they hear that message.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, if you identify a system for operating the organization that no one else has envisioned, you’ve already <em>demonstrated</em> that this part of the organization couldn’t run without you, and you don’t need to say it or prove it. There is power in the mere action of creating that system. But a lot depends on where you have both the positional authority and the social permission to actually accomplish that kind of thing.</p>\\n<p>So, if you’re dissatisfied with where you are, but have not decided to leave your current organization, then your first orders of business in this new year should be to consolidate power through building alliances with peers, and by understanding which fundamental systems of your organization you can define or influence, and thus be in control of. Once you’ve got power, you’ve got options.</p>\\n<h3>Most tech isn’t “tech”</h3>\\n<p>So far, we’re talking about very abstract stuff. What do we do if your job sucks right now, or if you don’t have a job today and you really need one? After vague things like systems and power, then what?</p>\\n<p>Well, an important thing to understand, if you care about innovation and technology, is that the vast majority of technology doesn’t happen in the startup world, or even in the “tech industry”. Startups are only a tiny fraction of the entire realm of companies that create or use technology, and the giant tech companies are only a small percentage of all jobs or hiring within the tech realm.</p>\\n<p>So much opportunity, inspiration, creativity, and possibility lies in applying the skills and experience that you may have from technological disciplines in other realms and industries that are often far less advanced in their deployment of technologies. In a lot of cases, these other businesses get taken advantage of for their lack of experience —\\xa0and in the non-profit world, the lack of tech expertise or fluency is often exploited by both the technology vendors and bad actors who swoop in to capitalize on their vulnerability.</p>\\n<p>Many of the people I talk to who bring their technology experience to other fields also tell me that the culture in more traditional industries is often less toxic or broken than things in Silicon Valley (or Silicon Valley-based) companies are these days, since older or more established companies have had time to work out the more extreme aspects of their culture. It’s an extraordinary moment in history when people who work on Wall Street tell me that even <em>their</em> HR departments wouldn’t put up with the kind of bad behavior that we’re seeing within the ranks of tech company execs.</p>\\n<h3>Plan for the long term</h3>\\n<p>This too shall pass. One of the great gifts of working in technology is that it’s given so many of us the habit of constantly learning, of always being curious and paying attention to the new things worth discovering. That healthy and open-minded spirit is an important part of how to navigate a moment when lots of people are being laid off, or lots of energy and attention are being focused on products and initiatives that don’t have a lot of substance behind them.\\nEventually, people will want to return to what’s real. The companies that focus on delivering products with meaning, and taking care of employees over time, will be the ones that are able to persist past the current moment. So building habits that enable resiliency at both a personal and professional level is going to be key.</p>\\n<p>As I’ve been fond of saying for a long time: don’t let your job get in the way of your career.</p>\\n<p>Build habits and routines that serve your own professional goals. As much as you can, participate in the things that get your name out into your professional community, whether that’s in-person events in your town, or writing on a regular basis about your area of expertise, or mentoring with those who are new to your field. You’ll never regret building relationships with people, or being generous with your knowledge in ways that remind others that you’re great at what you do.</p>\\n<p>If your time and budget permit, attend events in person or online where you can learn from others or respond to the ideas that others are sharing. The more people can see and remember that you’re engaged with the conversations about your discipline, the greater the likelihood that they’ll reach out when the next opportunity arises.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, take every chance you can to be generous to others when you see a door open that might be valuable for them. I can promise you, people will <em>never</em> forget that you thought of them in their time of need, even if they don’t end up getting that role or nabbing that interview.</p>\\n<h2>It’s an evolution, not a resolution</h2>\\n<p>New years are often a time when people make a promise to themselves about how they’re going to change everything. If I can just get this new notebook to write in, I’m suddenly going to become a person who keeps a journal, and that will make me a person who’s on top of everything all the time.</p>\\n<p>But hopefully you can see, many of the challenges that so many people are facing are systemic, and aren’t the result of any personal failings or shortcomings. So there isn’t some heroic individual change that you can make when you flip over to a new calendar month that will suddenly fix all the things.</p>\\n<p>What you can control, though, are small iterative things that make you feel better on a human scale, in little ways, when you can. You can help yourself maintain perspective, and you can do the same for those around you who share your values, and who care about the same personal or professional goals that you do.</p>\\n<p>A lot of us still care about things like the potential for technology to help people, or still believe in the idealistic and positive goals that got us into our careers in the first place. We weren’t wrong, or naive, or foolish to aspire to those goals simply because some bad actors sought to undermine them. And it’s okay to feel frustrated or scared in a time when it seems to many like those goals could be further away than they’ve been in a long time.</p>\\n<p>I do hope, though, that people can see that, by sticking together, and focusing on the things that are within our reach, things can begin to change. All it takes is remembering that the power in tech truly rests with all the people who actually <em>make</em> things, not with the loudmouths at the top who try to tear things down.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://anildash.com/', 'value': '<p>One of the key points I repeated when <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/\">talking about the state of the tech industry yesterday</a> was the salient fact that <em>half a million tech workers have been laid off since ChatGPT was released in late 2022</em>. Now, to be clear, those workers haven’t been laid off because their jobs are now being done by AI, and they’ve been replaced by bots. Instead, they’ve been laid off by execs who now have AI to use as an excuse for going after workers they’ve wanted to cut all along.</p>\\n<p>This is important to understand for a few reasons. First, it’s key just for having empathy for both the mindset and the working conditions of people in the tech industry. For so many outside of tech, their impression of what “tech” means is whatever is the most recent transgression they’ve heard about from the most obnoxious billionaire who’s made the news lately. But in many cases, it’s the rank and file workers at that person’s company who were the first victims of that billionaire’s ego.</p>\\n<p>Second, it’s important to understand the big tech companies as almost the testing grounds for the techniques and strategies that these guys want to roll out on the rest of the economy, and on the rest of the world. Before they started going on podcasts pretending to be extremely masculine while whining about their feelings, or overtly bribing politicians to give them government contracts, they beta-tested these manipulative strategies within their companies by cracking down on dissent and letting their most self-indulgent and egomaniacal tendencies run wild. Then, when people (reasonably!) began to object, they used that as an excuse to purge any dissenters for being uncooperative or “difficult”.</p>\\n<h2>It starts with tech, but doesn’t end there</h2>\\n<p>These are tactics they’ll be bringing to other industries and sectors of the economy, if they haven’t already. Sometimes they’ll be providing AI technologies and tools as an enabler or justification for the cultural and political agenda that they’re enacting, but often times, they don’t even need to. In many cases, they can simply make clear that they want to enforce psychological and social conformity within their organizations, and that any disagreement will not be tolerated, and the implicit threat of being replaced by automation (or by other workers who are willing to fall in line) is enough to get people to comply.</p>\\n<p>This is the subtext, and sometimes the explicit text, of the deployment of “AI” in a lot of organizations. That’s separate from what actual AI software or technology can do. And it explains a lot of why the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/\">majority AI view</a> within the tech industry is nothing like the hype cycle that’s being pushed by the loudest voices of the big-name CEOs.</p>\\n<p>Because people who work in tech still believe in the power of tech to do good things, many of us won’t just dismiss outright the possibility that any technology — even AI tools like LLMs\\xa0— could yield some benefits. But the optimistic takes are tempered by the first-hand knowledge of how the tools are being used as an excuse to sideline or victimize good people.</p>\\n<p>This wave of layoffs and reductions has been described as “pursuing efficiencies” or “right-sizing”. But so many of us in tech can remember a few years back, when working in tech as an upwardly-mobile worker with a successful career felt like the best job in the world. When many people could buy nice presents for their kids at Christmas or they weren’t as worried about your car payments. When huge parts of society were promising young people that there was a great future ahead if they would just learn to code. When the promise of a tech career’s potential was used as the foundation for building infrastructure in our schools and cities to train a whole new generation of coders.</p>\\n<p>But the funders and tycoons in charge of the big tech companies <em>knew</em> that they did not want to keep paying enormous salaries to the people they were hiring. They certainly knew they didn’t want to keep paying huge hiring bonuses to young people just out of college, or to pay large staffs of recruiters to go find underrepresented candidates. Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to <em>them</em>. So yes, part of the reason for the huge investment in AI coding tools was to make it easier to write code. But another huge reason that AI got so good at writing code was so that nobody would ever have to pay coders so well again.</p>\\n<p>You’re not wrong if you feel angry, resentful and overwhelmed by all of this; indeed, it would be absurd if you <em>didn’t</em> feel this way, since the wealthiest and most powerful people in the history of the world have been spending a few years trying to make you feel exactly this way. Constant rotating layoffs and a nonstop fear of further cuts, with a perpetual sense of precarity, are a deliberate strategy so that everyone will accept lower salaries and reduced benefits, and be too afraid to push for the exact same salaries that the company could afford to pay the year before.</p>\\n<h2>Why are we stirring the pot?</h2>\\n<p>Okay, so are we just trying to get each other all depressed? No. It’s just vitally important that we name a problem and identify it if we’re going to solve it.\\n\\u2028Most people outside of the technology industry think that “tech” is a monolith, that the people who work in tech are the same as the people who <em>own</em> the technology companies. They don’t know that tech workers are in the same boat that they are, being buffeted by the economy, and being subject to the whims of their bosses, or being displaced by AI. They don’t know that the DEI backlash has gutted HR teams at tech companies, too, for example. So it’s key for everyone to understand that they’re starting from the same place.</p>\\n<p>Next, it’s key to tease apart things that are separate concerns. For example: AI is often an <em>excuse</em> for layoffs, not the cause of them. ChatGPT didn’t replace the tasks that recruiters were doing in attracting underrepresented candidates at big tech companies — the bosses just don’t care about trying to hire underrepresented candidates anymore! The tech story is being used to mask the political and social goal. And it’s important to understand that, because otherwise people waste their time fighting battles that might not matter, like the deployment of a technology system, and losing the ones that do, like the actual decisions that an organization is making about its future.</p>\\n<h2>Are they efficient, though?</h2>\\n<p>But what if, some people will ask, these companies just had <em>too many people</em>? What if they’d over-hired? The folks who want to feel really savvy will say, “I heard that they had all those employees because interest rates were low. It was a Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.” This is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. It’s not in any company’s best interests to cut their staffing down to the bone.</p>\\n<p>You actually <em>need</em> to have some reserve capacity for labor in order to reach maximum output for a large organization. This is the difference between a large-scale organization and a small one. People sitting around doing nothing is the epitome of waste or inefficiency in a small team, but in a large organization, it’s a lot more costly if you are about to start a new process or project and you don’t have labor capacity or expertise to deploy.</p>\\n<p>A good analogy is the oft-cited need these days for people to be bored more often. There’s a frequent lament that, because people are so distracted by things like social media and constant interruptions, they never have time to get bored and let their mind wander, and think new thoughts or discover their own creativity. Put another way, they never get the chance to tap into their own cognitive surplus.</p>\\n<p>The only advantage a large organization can have over a small one, other than sheer efficiencies of scale, is if it has a cognitive surplus that it can tap into. By destroying that cognitive surplus, and leaving those who remain behind in a state of constant emotional turmoil and duress, these organizations are permanently damaging both their competitive advantages and their potential future innovations.</p>\\n<h2>AI Spring</h2>\\n<p>When the dust clears, and people realize that extreme greed is never the path to maximum long-term reward, there is going to be a “peace dividend” of sorts from all the good talent that’s now on the market. Some of this will be smart, thoughtful people flowing to other industries or companies, bringing their experience and insights with them.</p>\\n<p>But I think a lot of this will be people starting their own new companies and organizations, informed by the broken economic models, and broken <em>human</em> models, of the companies they’ve left. We saw this a generation ago after the bust of the dot-com boom, when it was not only revealed that the economics of a lot of the companies didn’t work, but that so many of the people who had created the companies of that era didn’t even care about the markets or the industries that they’d entered. When the get-rich-quick folks left the scene, those of us who remained, who truly loved the web as a creative and expressive medium, found a ton of opportunity in being the little mammals amidst the sad dinosaurs trying to find funding for meteor dot com.</p>\\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\\n<p>I don’t think this all gets better very quickly. If you put aside the puffery of the AI companies scratching each others’ backs, it’s clear the economy is in a recession, even if this administration’s goons have shut down reporting on jobs and inflation in a vain attempt to hide that reality. But I do think there may be more resilience because of the sheer talent and entrepreneurial skill of the people who are now on the market as individuals.</p>'}",
