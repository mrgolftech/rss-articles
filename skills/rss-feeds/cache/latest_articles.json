There's no reason not to continue to serve archived versions - a banner at the top of the page saying it's no longer maintained would be much better than removing all of that valuable content entirely.</p>\n<p>Up until 2020 the CIA published annual zip file archives of the entire site. Those are available (along with the rest of the Factbook) <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260203124934/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/\">on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>I downloaded the 384MB <code>.zip</code> file for the year 2020 and extracted it into a new GitHub repository, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020/\">simonw/cia-world-factbook-2020</a>.

This is the latest in their Whisper-like model family, and a sequel to the original Voxtral which they released <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/16/voxtral/\">in July 2025</a>.</p>\n<p>Voxtral Realtime - official name <code>Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602</code> - is the open weights (Apache-2.0) model, available as a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602\">8.87GB download from Hugging Face</a>.</p>\n<p>You can try it out in this <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-Realtime\">live demo</a> - don't be put off by the \"No microphone found\" message, clicking \"Record\" should have your browser request permission and then start the demo working. I was very impressed by the demo - I talked quickly and used jargon like Django and WebAssembly and it correctly transcribed my text within moments of me uttering each sound. </p>\n<p>The closed weight model is called <code>voxtral-mini-latest</code> and can be accessed via the Mistral API, using calls that look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl -X POST <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>https://api.mistral.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -H <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Authorization: Bearer <span class=\"pl-smi\">$MISTRAL_API_KEY</span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F model=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>voxtral-mini-latest<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F file=@<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Pelican talk at the library.m4a<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F diarize=true \\\n  -F context_bias=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Datasette<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> \\\n  -F timestamp_granularities=<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>segment<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n\n<p>The Mistral API console now has a <a href=\"https://console.mistral.ai/build/audio/speech-to-text\">speech-to-text playground</a> for exercising the new model and it is <em>excellent</em>.

When ChatGPT launched, it was trading at 14; it&#8217;s gone up by more than a factor of ten since then, rising, until recently like a rocket. </p><p>Aside from Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang, a brilliant and impressive CEO with considerable foresight, nobody was more responsible for Nvidia&#8217;s rise than Sam Altman, the relentless showman who runs OpenAI &#8212; and who repeatedly promised the moon. </p><p>My favorite representative quote from Altman, just over a year ago, came in January 2025, back when too many people had too much faith him, writing in his blog &#8220;we are now confident we know how to build AGI.&#8221; It turns out this was authoritative bullshit. It sounded true and was said with confidence, but it was purely a bluff. Altman didn&#8217;t actually know how to build AGI [artificial general intelligence] then, and probably still doesn&#8217;t. Nvidia&#8217;s rise was predicated on the wrong-headed idea (long critiqued in this newsletter) that scaling would bring us to AGI. </p><p>As long as the scaling = AGI myth persisted, Nvidia, which makes the GPUs that fuel scaling, continued to rise like a rocket.</p><p>But all that changed on August 7th. That was the day that Altman introduced his wildly overhyped (for years) GPT-5 to the world, alleging, falsely, that it could do anything a PhD could do. By the end of the night, there was a rebellion in LLM land; people tried out the long awaited, much delayed model immediately, and just as quickly realized that what Altman said wasn&#8217;t true.</p><p>Questions that only a few of us (like Ed Zitron and myself) had been raising were suddenly on everyone&#8217;s lips. The industry seemed to increasingly rely on circular financing, so much so that an alternative <a href=\"https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFV-ustfSw56Q/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZl2Bl7xIwAs-/0/1758621755066?e%3D2147483647%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DMlsuC_iwl3q1QZGbW2RxLu95TC-b9c0hFkkmlqoJTRk&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopherobrien_episode-8-season-1-of-hbos-silicon-valley-activity-7376194264587976704-aboB&amp;h=756&amp;w=800&amp;tbnid=KgOiD1AxwRwYIM&amp;tbnh=218&amp;tbnw=231&amp;osm=1&amp;hcb=1&amp;source=lens-native&amp;docid=5WAyz49VXBUF7M\">NSFW framing of circular financing became a  meme</a>. </p><p>That circularity is a warning sign, reflecting a market that is propped up rather than functioning well on its own accord. Wall Street lost confidence, particularly after the crazy Oracle deal in September that I called at the time &#8220;peak bubble&#8221;.</p><p>On August 7, 2025, Nvidia was trading at about 181; today it stands at 177, stalled, a remarkable six month plateau for a stock that had risen more than 10x from 14 after ChatGPT was released in November 2022.  Not an all out crash, but an unmistakable sign that its ascent has run out of gas. GPU-wrangler Coreweave stood then at about 129 and now stands at about 89. Oracle was at 250 and now (after its short lived OpenAI bump in September) stands at 150.</p><p>That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August &#8212; this Saturday will be the half anniversary &#8212; was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic. LLMs are great, but they aren&#8217;t AGI, and they aren&#8217;t reliable. Moreover, they are expensive to operate, and because many companies can build roughly the same thing, they are commodities.</p><p>No moat = price wars. </p><p>No AGI = modest, not immense, profits. </p><p>As the investment press has been saying of late, investors have been &#8220;rotating out of tech stocks<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>&#8221; &#8211; because they realize they were sold a bill of goods.  My guess is that these stocks &#8211; and the reputation of OpenAI &#8211; will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for. </p><p>Not, at least, until newer, better, more robust approaches to AI are developed. For a few years, it seemed like the markets were swayed by hype, alternatives shut out. All that is starting to change. At last the market may be both ready&#8212;and desperate&#8212;for real AI. </p><p>The best news here is that with LLM mania subsiding, there might actually be a chance for newcomers to try new things.</p><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>People are likely rotating out of tech stocks for two almost contradictory reasons: some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they&#8217;re worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software. I am not sure that latter worry is realistic.</p><p></p></div></div>'}",

Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, <em>The Hospital at the End of the World</em>:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866\">https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866</a></p>\\n<p>I\\'ve followed Key\\'s work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers\\' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me &#8211; a standout writer in a year full of standouts &#8211; and I wasn\\'t surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, <em>The World Wasn\\'t Ready For You</em>, in 2023:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015</a></p>\\n<p>This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don\\'t publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven\\'t already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they\\'re names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll</a></p>\\n<p>But anyone who read <em>World Wasn\\'t Ready</em> immediately understood why Key\\'s work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops.</p>\\n<p><em>Hospital at the End of the World</em> is Key\\'s first novel, and it\\'s terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, <em>Hospital</em> follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok\\'s father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings.</p>\\n<p>The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from <em>every</em> medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That\\'s when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father.</p>\\n<p>To make things worse, Pok\\'s father has fallen grievously ill &#8211; so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn\\'t accompany his father, though &#8211; he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok\\'s apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization.</p>\\n<p>Thus begins Pok\\'s tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America\\'s AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok\\'s father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization\\'s rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine.</p>\\n<p>Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people.</p>\\n<p>This is the book\\'s second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth.</p>\\n<p>What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key\\'s own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It\\'s one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care. It\\'s a well-structured, well-paced sf novel that probes big, urgent contemporary themes while still engrossing the reader in the intimate human relations of its principals. A wonderful debut novel from a major new writer.`</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ken MacLeod: Imagined Futures <a href=\"https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/\">https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Elbows Up: How Canada Can Disenshittify Its Tech, Reclaim Its Sovereignty, and Launch a New Tech Sector Into a Stable Orbit <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation\">https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>HOPE IS NOW A 501(C)(3) NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION <a href=\"https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization\">https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Department of Justice appeals Google search monopoly ruling <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal\">https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>List of Kennedy Center cancellations during the Trump administration <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration</a> (h/t Amanda Marcotte)</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"retro\"></a><br />\\n<img alt=\"A shelf of leatherbound history books with a gilt-stamped series title, \\'The World\\'s Famous Events.\\'\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/worlds-famous-events.png?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<h1>Object permanence (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#retro\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p>#20yrsago AOL/Yahoo: our email tax will make the net as good as the post office! <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html</a></p>\\n<p>#20yrsago Volunteers ferry 15k coconuts every day to Indian temple <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Wikileaks ACTA cables confirm it was a screwjob for the global poor <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/\">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Laura Poitras’s Astro Noise: indispensable book and gallery show about mass surveillance <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/\">https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago How to prepare to join the Internet of the dead <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead\">https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Who funds the “Millennials Rising” Super PAC?

    "summary": "<p>I've been exploring Go for building small, fast and self-contained binary applications recently. I'm enjoying how there's generally one obvious way to do things and the resulting code is boring and readable - and something that LLMs are very competent at writing. The one catch is distribution, but it turns out publishing Go binaries to PyPI means any Go binary can be just a <code>uvx package-name</code> call away.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner\">sqlite-scanner</a> is my new Go CLI tool for scanning a filesystem for SQLite database files.</p>\n<p>It works by checking if the first 16 bytes of the file exactly match the SQLite magic number sequence <code>SQLite format 3\\x00</code>. It can search one or more folders recursively, spinning up concurrent goroutines to accelerate the scan. It streams out results as it finds them in plain text, JSON or newline-delimited JSON. It can optionally display the file sizes as well.</p>\n<p>To try it out you can download a release from the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner/releases\">GitHub releases</a> - and then <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445\">jump through macOS hoops</a> to execute an \"unsafe\" binary. Or you can clone the repo and compile it with Go. Or... you can run the binary like this:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default this will search your current directory for SQLite databases. You can pass one or more directories as arguments:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner ~ /tmp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add <code>--json</code> for JSON output, <code>--size</code> to include file sizes or <code>--jsonl</code> for newline-delimited JSON. Here's a demo:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx sqlite-scanner ~ --jsonl --size\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"running that command produces a sequence of JSON objects, each with a path and a size key\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sqlite-scanner-demo.gif\" /></p>\n<p>If you haven't been uv-pilled yet you can instead install <code>sqlite-scanner</code> using <code>pip install sqlite-scanner</code> and then run <code>sqlite-scanner</code>.</p>\n<p>To get a permanent copy with <code>uv</code> use <code>uv tool install sqlite-scanner</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-the-python-package-works\">How the Python package works</h4>\n<p>The reason this is worth doing is that <code>pip</code>, <code>uv</code> and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a> will work together to identify the correct compiled binary for your operating system and architecture.</p>\n<p>This is driven by file names. If you visit <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/#files\">the PyPI downloads for sqlite-scanner</a> you'll see the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-win_arm64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-win_amd64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-musllinux_1_2_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-musllinux_1_2_aarch64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl</code></li>\n<li><code>sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I run <code>pip install sqlite-scanner</code> or <code>uvx sqlite-scanner</code> on my Apple Silicon Mac laptop Python's packaging magic ensures I get that <code>macosx_11_0_arm64.whl</code> variant.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.pythonhosted.org%2Fpackages%2F88%2Fb1%2F17a716635d2733fec53ba0a8267f85bd6b6cf882c6b29301bc711fba212c%2Fsqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl#sqlite_scanner/__init__.py\">what's in the wheel</a>, which is a zip file with a <code>.whl</code> extension.</p>\n<p>In addition to the <code>bin/sqlite-scanner</code> the most important file is <code>sqlite_scanner/__init__.py</code> which includes the following:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">get_binary_path</span>():\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">\"\"\"Return the path to the bundled binary.\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">join</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">dirname</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">__file__</span>), <span class=\"pl-s\">\"bin\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s\">\"sqlite-scanner\"</span>)\n \n    <span class=\"pl-c\"># Ensure binary is executable on Unix</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">platform</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">!=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">\"win32\"</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">stat</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>).<span class=\"pl-c1\">st_mode</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">not</span> (<span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXUSR</span>):\n            <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">chmod</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">current_mode</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXUSR</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXGRP</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">stat</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">S_IXOTH</span>)\n \n    <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>\n \n \n<span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">main</span>():\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">\"\"\"Execute the bundled binary.\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">get_binary_path</span>()\n \n    <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">platform</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">==</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">\"win32\"</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-c\"># On Windows, use subprocess to properly handle signals</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">exit</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">subprocess</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">call</span>([<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>] <span class=\"pl-c1\">+</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">argv</span>[<span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>:]))\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">else</span>:\n        <span class=\"pl-c\"># On Unix, exec replaces the process</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-s1\">os</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">execvp</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>, [<span class=\"pl-s1\">binary</span>] <span class=\"pl-c1\">+</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">sys</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">argv</span>[<span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>:])</pre>\n<p>That <code>main()</code> method -

It means that any functionality which is available in a cross-platform Go binary can now be subsumed into a Python package. Python is really good at running subprocesses so this opens up a whole world of useful tricks that we can bake into our Python tools.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate this, I built <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan\">datasette-scan</a> - a new Datasette plugin which depends on <code>sqlite-scanner</code> and then uses that Go binary to scan a folder for SQLite databases and attach them to a Datasette instance.</p>\n<p>Here's how to use that (without even installing anything first, thanks <code>uv</code>) to explore any SQLite databases in your Downloads folder:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with datasette-scan datasette scan <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/Downloads</pre></div>\n<p>If you peek at the code you'll see it <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/pyproject.toml#L14\">depends on sqlite-scanner</a> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and calls it using <code>subprocess.run()</code> against <code>sqlite_scanner.get_binary_path()</code> in its own <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-scan/blob/1a2b6d1e6b04c8cd05f5676ff7daa877efd99f08/datasette_scan/__init__.py#L38-L58\">scan_directories() function</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been exploring this pattern for other, non-Go binaries recently - here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/livestream-gif.py\">a recent script</a> that depends on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/static-ffmpeg/\">static-ffmpeg</a> to ensure that <code>ffmpeg</code> is available for the script to use.</p>\n<h4 id=\"building-python-wheels-from-go-packages-with-go-to-wheel\">Building Python wheels from Go packages with go-to-wheel</h4>\n<p>After trying this pattern myself a couple of times I realized it would be useful to have a tool to automate the process.</p>\n<p>I first <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/2d9ced56-b3e8-4651-83cc-860b9b419187\">brainstormed with Claude</a> to check that there was no existing tool to do this. It pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.maturin.rs/bindings.html#bin\">maturin bin</a> which helps distribute Rust projects using Python wheels, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Bing-su/pip-binary-factory\">pip-binary-factory</a> which bundles all sorts of other projects, but did not identify anything that addressed the exact problem I was looking to solve.</p>\n<p>So I <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?41f04e4eb823b1ceb888d9a28c2280dd/index.html\">had Claude Code for web build the first version</a>, then refined the code locally on my laptop with the help of more Claude Code and a little bit of OpenAI Codex too, just to mix things up.</p>\n<p>The full documentation is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">simonw/go-to-wheel</a> repository. I've published that tool to PyPI so now you can run it using:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel --help</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>sqlite-scanner</code> package you can <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/\">see on PyPI</a> was built using <code>go-to-wheel</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx go-to-wheel <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/dev/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --set-version-var main.version \\\n  --version 0.1.1 \\\n  --readme README.md \\\n  --author <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Simon Willison<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  --url https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner \\\n  --description <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Scan directories for SQLite databases<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This created a set of wheels in the <code>dist/</code> folder. I tested one of them like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv run --with dist/sqlite_scanner-0.1.1-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl \\\n  sqlite-scanner --version</pre></div>\n<p>When that spat out the correct version number I was confident everything had worked as planned, so I pushed the whole set of wheels to PyPI using <code>twine upload</code> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx twine upload dist/<span class=\"pl-k\">*</span></pre></div>\n<p>I had to paste in a PyPI API token I had saved previously and that was all it took.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-expect-to-use-this-pattern-a-lot\">I expect to use this pattern a lot</h4>\n<p><code>sqlite-scanner</code> is very clearly meant as a proof-of-concept for this wider pattern - Python is very much capable of recursively crawling a directory structure looking for files that start with a specific byte prefix on its own!</p>\n<p>That said, I think there's a <em>lot</em> to be said for this pattern. Go is a great complement to Python - it's fast, compiles to small self-contained binaries, has excellent concurrency support and a rich ecosystem of libraries.</p>\n<p>Go is similar to Python in that it has a strong standard library. Go is particularly good for HTTP tooling - I've built several HTTP proxies in the past using Go's excellent <code>net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy</code> handler.</p>\n<p>I've also been experimenting with <a href=\"https://github.com/wazero/wazero\">wazero</a>, Go's robust and mature zero dependency WebAssembly runtime as part of my ongoing quest for the ideal sandbox for running untrusted code. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/wasm-repl-cli\">Here's my latest experiment</a> with that library.</p>\n<p>Being able to seamlessly integrate Go binaries into Python projects without the end user having to think about Go at all - they <code>pip install</code> and everything Just Works - feels like a valuable addition to my toolbox.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/packaging\">packaging</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pypi\">pypi</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/sqlite\">sqlite</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/uv\">uv</a></p>",

Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id=\"fnref:gross-additions\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:gross-additions\">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>\n<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general \"themes\" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/\" target=\"_blank\">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href=\"https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this \"compatibility\" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>\n<p>Just like all the content was in <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/\" target=\"_blank\">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/\" target=\"_blank\">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/\" target=\"_blank\">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>\n<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's \"just\" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>\n<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Conference Season</h2>\n<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy! Here's where I'm speaking so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://qconlondon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QCon London</a>, March 16-19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://craft-conf.com/2026\" target=\"_blank\">Craft Conference</a>, Budapest, June 4-5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareshould.work/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Should Work</a>, Missouri, July 16-17</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hfpug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Functional Programmers</a>, Virtual, December 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the first three I'm giving variations of my talk \"How to find bugs in systems that don't exist\", which I gave last year at <a href=\"https://systemsdistributed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Systems Distributed</a>.

The Examiner is, frankly, more of the same - and I\\'m happy with that!</p>\\n\\n<p>You, the reader, are given a series of transcripts and have to work out what crime (if any) has been committed. You don\\'t find out who the victim(s) is/are until reasonably far through the story. The characters are well realised (although a little similar to some of her others). The twists are shockingly good and will make you flick back to see if you could have spotted them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Hallett is <em>exquisite</em> at building tension through the slow drip-drip-drip of reveals. OK, so the transcripts are a bit unrealistic but they make a good scaffold. While it might be nice to include user avatars on the WhatsApp messages, the characters\\' voices are unique enough to distinguish them easily.</p>\\n\\n<p>Much like <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/book-review-the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-by-janice-hallett/\">The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</a>, the book plays around with symbolism and the nature of faith. You may find yourself sympathising with the characters and then quickly recanting!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"technical-issues\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/book-review-the-examiner-janice-hallett/#technical-issues\">Technical Issues</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Viper, the publisher, seem to have messed up the structure of this eBook. Despite being published in 2024, they\\'re using an <em>ancient</em> and obsolete version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz/\">Blitz ePub CSS</a> which itself was archived back in 2020. As well as strange indents, there\\'s a hard-coded 2em margin only on the right.</p>\\n\\n<p>Accessibility is poor. All the abbreviations use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element. But some kind of automated find-and-replace has mangled most of them. For example, the \"Masters degree in Multimedia Art (Full-Time Programme)\" is shortened to \"MMAM(FTP)\" and then given the nonsensical abbreviation of \"Molecular Area Per Molecule (File Transfer Protocol)\"!</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/how-long-does-it-take-to-upgrade-an-ebook/\">Much like before</a> I\\'ve written to them asking them to correct it.</p>'}",

    "summary": "<p>After the acquisition by a much larger company, security became a top priority. Our company occupied three tall buildings, each at least 13 stories high. Key card readers were installed next to every entrance, every elevator car, and even at the parking lot entrance, which itself was eight stories tall.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The parking lot system was activated first. If you wanted to park your car, you needed to scan your pass. It didn't take long for lines to start forming, but they were still manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Then the doors were activated. I would often forget my key card on my desk and get stuck in the stairwell. After lunch, I'd climb the stairs all the way to the 11th floor, only to find myself locked out at the door. Fortunately, the buildings were full of people, and there was always someone to open the door for me. I'd slip in suspiciously while they contemplated the email that clearly said not to let anyone in with your own card.</p>\n\n<p>While we were battling to get used to the key cards, the company was installing turnstiles on the ground floor of every building. They looked futuristic, but I was already anticipating a problem the designers hadn't considered. Each building had 13 floors. Each floor was full of employees. Hundreds of employees per building would each have to scan their card to get in.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer. I understand that security isn't an optional feature you build on top of your application. Instead, you need to implement safeguards at the foundation. In fact, one of the most important applications I was working on was a tool to manage how different teams retrieved their tasks from Jira. If you've read this blog before, you know I always complain about Jira.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the original designer of this application must have been pressed for time. Each action in the app required a call to the Jira endpoint, which needed authentication. He never saved the auth token returned by the API. Instead, each call had to re-authenticate and then perform its task.</p>\n\n<p>Did he ask the user to reenter the password every single time? No, he was smarter than that. Did he save the credentials in the database in plain text? He might have <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/hiring-angular-experts-not\">been an intern</a>, but he wasn't crazy. No! Instead, he saved the username and password in the cookies. But for good measures, it was base64 encoded.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we received the email. All turnstiles were going to be activated. The following Monday, they would run in mock mode, where the turnstiles would remain open, but we'd have to scan and wait for the beep and green light before entering.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at 8:30am. I met my colleagues and hundreds of other employees in the lobby. When the first person scanned their card, the machine beeped and turned green. We all clapped in celebration. We took turns making our way to the machine. Beep, turn green, next. But it grumbled for some employees and turned red. That was fine though, it was mock day. We all went about our day.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, when I came to work, I remained in my car, stuck in line for the parking lot for at least 10 minutes. Looking outside, I saw long lines of people circling each building.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to park my car and discovered that the line of people extended all the way down to the parking level. I waited in line for at least 30 minutes just to make it to the lobby. I texted my manager that I'd be late for the daily standup because I was stuck in line. She didn't text back. Instead, she waved at me from the front of the line. Scanning was already slow, you had to wait to be approved. But once you passed the turnstile, there was another line for the elevators. The elevator key card readers were also active.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a couple dozen people all trying to squeeze into crowded elevators, each going to a different floor, and each trying to scan their key card to access their floor because someone who wasn't authorized for that floor couldn't scan it for them. Some elevator doors opened with a few people already inside because they couldn't scan their cards in the crowd, so they'd gone back down for a second attempt. In other words, it was complete chaos.</p>\n\n<p>It took more than an hour to go from the parking lot to my desk on the 11th floor.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I decided to save time and take an Uber to work. Those were the days when an <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/paying-for-my-8-years-old-ride\">Uber ride cost only $3</a>. I thought I was being smart, but another hundred people or so had the same idea. We had a pile of Uber rides lining up outside, each trying to drop off their riders and blocking the way to the parking lot, causing yet another traffic jam. Inside the building, it was still the same chaos. I only saved a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>On the third day, they shut down the turnstiles. They clearly weren't working. They also disabled the key card readers in the elevators. It was a relief.</p>\n\n<p>Security was supposedly a priority, yet nobody ever talked about the Jira credentials saved in cookies. I received significant pushback when I requested we install a Redis service to store the generated auth tokens. I had to write entire documents to justify using it and request enterprise support from a vendor. After a month, the security issue was fixed to no fanfare.</p>\n\n<p>We did, however, receive an email celebrating the installation of three new turnstiles in the lobby. They never turned the elevator key card readers back on. They remained dormant, a reminder of the mess we'd gone through.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The turnstiles were visible. They were expensive. They disrupted everyone's day and made headlines in company-wide emails. Management could point to them and say that we're taking security seriously. Meanwhile, thousands of employees had their Jira credentials stored in cookies. A vulnerability that could expose our entire project management system. But that fix required documentation, vendor approval, a month of convincing people it mattered. A whole lot of begging.</p>\n\n<p>Security theater checks a box. It makes people feel like something is being done. Real security is invisible. It's reviewing code, implementing proper authentication, storing tokens correctly. It doesn't come with a ribbon-cutting ceremony or a celebratory email. It's just good engineering that nobody notices when it's done right. But security theater is impossible to miss.</p>",

I posted a little about this on Facebook and LinkedIn, but thought I&apos;d expand on what really stuck with me after watching other speakers: the effort agencies are putting into cybercrime prevention. It&apos;s very easy for folks to judge law enforcement solely on what they see from the outside, and that&apos;s mostly going after offenders and taking down criminal infrastructure. But the bit I&apos;m increasingly seeing behind the scenes is a push to help kids (the sorts of hackers I usually interact with are teenagers or young adults at most) make better choices when they&apos;re faced with a pathway into cybercrime. The transition from minor offences (game cheats and DDoS&apos;ing) to full-on cybercriminals (hacking and extortion) is very well-known, and intervening at the right time can not only make a difference to the impact of data breaches on all of us, but it can also make a massive difference to these kids&apos; lives. These agencies are underfunded and understaffed compared to the scale of the problem, so making the time to come visit and find some ways to help in our little corner of the data breach world is a no-brainer &#x1f60a;</p>\\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\\n<div><div style=\"width: 170px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/troy-hunts-weekly-update-podcast/id1176454699?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Listen-on-Apple-Podcasts.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 175px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LAAxaabizMAXnJe0s3xjQ30q12EVmjt&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/09/Watch-and-Listen-on-YouTube.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 118px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7jMtKFohdrw6qmz8AkLqit?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/10/spotify.svg\" /></a></div><div style=\"width: 120px; display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/troy-hunt-weekly-update/playlists/podcast.rss?ref=troy-hunt\"><img alt=\"Weekly Update 489\" src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/07/Download-via-RSS.svg\" /></a></div></div>\\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->'}",

SpaceX will be oh so much better with access to all your tweets and xAI&#8217;s models! That&#8217;s the narrative Elon&#8217;s selling. You can read it on the SpaceX website, which tells us that the merged everything company will be &#8220;the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world&#8217;s foremost real-time information and free speech platform&#8221;. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=a+floor+wax+that%27s+also+a+dessert+topping%21+gilda&amp;iar=videos&amp;t=ipad&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzOlhHakrKeE\">a floor wax that&#8217;s also a dessert topping!</a>  Hopefully back in the real world the good folks at SpaceX aren&#8217;t about to replace their carefully-developed symbolic navigation algorithms with an LLM trained on X. Kaboom.</p><p>Theory Two (&#8220;Musk is tightening his grip over the tech that shapes national security, social media, and Al&#8221;, per WIRED) is that Elon wants to run the world, and what&#8217;s better than a soup to nuts integration between owning your tweets and owning the satellites your data crosses? I don&#8217;t doubt for a minute  that Musk wants to tighten his grip on all of that, but I don&#8217;t immediately see how this move accomplishes that.</p><p>Theory Three (&#8220;Musk&#8217;s SpaceX-xAl deal is an ambitious bet that the future of Al compute is in space&#8221;, per the Information) also seems dodgy. I hear all the chatter about build data centers in space, but a joint venture between the satellite company and the people building infrastructure for XAI might suffice. If you even believe at all that data centers in space are really going to be a big, profitable thing in the next decade. (Count me skeptical, though the economics of such things is not my area of expertise.)</p><p>Me, I think the merger is really a kind of bailout, to give a lot of cash to a company that is otherwise in distress. Fact is, xAI ain&#8217;t doing all that great. It&#8217;s burning money fast, with no obvious business model or market niche, and has little to show for it. They have also faced a lot of backlash for being reckless and irresponsible; hardly a good brand name. Grok (their main product) doesn&#8217;t have the users that ChatGPT has, and it doesn&#8217;t have the prestige that Google&#8217;s Gemini seems to be racking up. It also doesn&#8217;t have the clear corporate focus that Anthropic has. Nor does it have any obvious secret sauce. These numbers below from The Information are jawdropping. Would you want to give up valuable SpaceX shares for an also-ran?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yrbJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bc1e4aa-90fe-4027-96c1-df982be5a259_2005x774.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yrbJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bc1e4aa-90fe-4027-96c1-df982be5a259_2005x774.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>For me anyway, the math ain&#8217;t mathing. Trading SpaceX at sixty times 2025 revenue seems, um, optimistic, but at least they have a near-monopoly on both low-cost rackets and satellite internet infrastructure. In contrast, trading xAI at a thousand times revenue when they are in an increasingly crowded field where everyone is being forced into price wars seems nuts. If I owned SpaceX shares I would feel like Elon way overpaid for his own company. For not that much more they could have bought Anthropic, which has had far broader adoption and far less controversy attached to it. </p><p>Anyone remember Tesla&#8217;s acquisition of Musk&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity\">SolarCity</a>, and how that turned out?</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Ps Update to my Sunday essay on OpenClaw.

    "summary": "<p>You’ve probably heard this famous quote from Steve Jobs about saying ‘no’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, we have AI now. We don’t have to say no to 1,000 things. We can say yes to all the things — generate them all, simultaneously!</p>\n<p>Do you really have to “pick carefully” when AI can materialize everything you previously would’ve been too constrained to do?</p>\n<p>Generative technology paired with being “data-driven” means it’s easy to build every idea, ship it, measure it, and see what sticks.</p>\n<p>Humans, money, time — these all used to be constraints which required budgets, trade-offs, and decision making.</p>\n<p>Organizations had an incentive to say “no” when development was constrained — “We can only do so much, so let’s make sure we do the most impactful things.”</p>\n<p>But maybe the scarcity of organizational resources was the wrong focus all along?</p>\n<p>It’s never been a good idea to ship everything you think of. Every addition accretes complexity and comes with a cognitive cost.</p>\n<p>Maybe we need to reframe the concept of scarcity from <em>us</em>, the makers of software, to <em>them</em>, the users of software. Their resources are what matter most:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention (too many features and they can’t all be used, or even tried)</li>\n<li>Stability (too much frequent change is an impediment to learning a product)</li>\n<li>Clarity (too many options creates confusion and paralysis)</li>\n<li>Coherence (too many plots and subplots cannot tell a unified story)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So maybe the way you argue for saying “no” isn’t because it helps <em>you</em> as a business, but because it helps your customers. It helps them make sense of what you’ve made.</p>\n<p>And yet: arguing for customer clarity has always been harder than arguing for internal efficiency or some bottom line.</p>\n<p>In an age of abundance, restraint becomes the only scarce thing left, which means saying “no” is more valuable than ever.</p>\n<p>I’m as proud of the things I haven’t generated as the things I have.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/saying-no/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",

He spent his whole career documenting the fact that &#8220;free&#8221; parking ultimately backfires, and it&#8217;s better to charge for parking instead and use the revenues to make neighborhoods nicer: plant trees, spruce up the parks, keep the sidewalks clean.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p><p>Shoup&#8217;s ideas have been adopted all over the world, with heartening results. When you price parking appropriately, traffic goes down, fewer people get tickets, and you know there&#8217;s going to be a space waiting for you when you arrive.</p><p>Many so-called &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; strive for such an impact and never come close. What made Shoup so effective? Three things, <a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">says his student M. Nolan Gray</a>:</p><ol><li><p>He picked an unsexy topic where low-hanging fruit was just waiting to be picked.</p></li><li><p>He made his ideas palatable to all sorts of politics, explaining to conservatives, libertarians, progressives, and socialists how pay-for-parking regimes fit into each of their ideologies.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p></li><li><p>He maintained strict message discipline. When asked about the Israel-Palestine protests on campus, he reportedly responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m just wondering where they all parked&#8221;.</p></li></ol><p>So the next time you find a convenient parking spot, thank Shoup, and the next time you want to apply your wits to improving the world, <em>be </em>Shoup.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3tsg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6724b2-a41f-4687-ad64-b45da204d99d_1024x768.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"437.25\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3tsg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6724b2-a41f-4687-ad64-b45da204d99d_1024x768.png\" width=\"583\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>2. BE A PUBLIC CHARACTER</strong></h1><p>Jane Jacobs, the great urban theorist, once wrote that the health of a neighborhood depends on its &#8220;public characters&#8221;.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> For instance, two public characters in Jacobs&#8217; neighborhood are Mr. and Mrs. Jaffe, who own a convenience store. On one winter morning, Jacobs observes the Jaffes provide the following services to the neighborhood, all free of charge:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>supervised the small children crossing at the corner on the way to [school]</p></li><li><p>lent an umbrella to one customer and a dollar to another</p></li><li><p>took custody of a watch to give the repair man across the street when he opened later</p></li><li><p>gave out information on the range of rents in the neighborhood to an apartment seeker</p></li><li><p>listened to a tale of domestic difficulty and offered reassurance</p></li><li><p>told some rowdies they could not come in unless they behaved and then defined (and got) good behavior</p></li><li><p>provided an incidental forum for half a dozen conversations among customers who dropped in for oddments</p></li><li><p>set aside certain newly arrived papers and magazines for regular customers who would depend on getting them</p></li><li><p>advised a mother who came for a birthday present not to get the ship-model kit because another child going to the same birthday party was giving that</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Some people think they can&#8217;t contribute to the world because they have no unique skills. How can you help if you don&#8217;t know kung fu or brain surgery? But as Jacobs writes, &#8220;A public character need have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function&#8212;although he often does. He just needs to be present [...] his main qualification is that he <em>is </em>public, that he talks to lots of different people.&#8221; Sometimes all we need is a warm body that is willing to be <em>extra </em>warm.</p><h1><strong>3. MAKE A SOCIAL NUCLEATION SITE</strong></h1><p>I once did a high school science fair experiment where I put Mentos in different carbonated beverages and measured the height of the resulting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_geyser\">geysers</a>. The scientific value of this project was, let&#8217;s say, <em>limited</em>, but I did learn something interesting: despite how it looks to the naked eye, bubbles don&#8217;t come from nowhere. They only form at <em>nucleation sites</em>&#8212;little pits and scratches where molecules can gather until they reach critical mass.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9-6P!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc95b0ce7-4cce-42a8-a6b8-45010506444d_5478x1562.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9-6P!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc95b0ce7-4cce-42a8-a6b8-45010506444d_5478x1562.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">the title page of my science fair report (photo cred: my dad)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The same thing is true of human relationships. People are constantly crashing against each other in the great sea of humanity, but only under special conditions do they form the molecular bonds of friendship. As far as I can tell, these social nucleation sites only appear in the presence of what I would call <em>unreasonable attentiveness</em>.</p><p>For instance, my freshman year hallmates were uncommonly close because our resident advisor was uncommonly intense. Most other groups shuffle halfheartedly through the orientation day scavenger hunt; Kevin instructed us to show up in gym shorts and running shoes, and barked at us back and forth across campus as we attempted to locate the engineering library and the art museum. When we narrowly missed first place, he hounded the deans until they let us share in the coveted grand prize, a trip to Six Flags.</p><p>We bonded after that, not just because we had all gotten our brains rattled at the same frequency on the Superman rollercoaster, but because we could all share a knowing look with each other like, &#8220;<em>This </em>guy, right?&#8221; Kevin&#8217;s unreasonable attentiveness made our hallway A Thing. He created a furrow in the fabric of social space-time where a gaggle of 18-year-olds could glom together.</p><p>Being in the presence of unreasonable attentiveness isn&#8217;t always pleasant, but then, nucleation sites are technically imperfections. Bubbles don&#8217;t form in a perfectly smooth glass, and human groups don&#8217;t form in perfectly smooth experiences. Unreasonable attentiveness creates the slight unevenness that helps people realize they need something to hold onto&#8212;namely, each other.</p><h1><strong>4. SELL ONIONS ON THE INTERNET</strong></h1><p>Peter Askew didn&#8217;t intend to become an onion merchant. He just happened to be a compulsive buyer of domain names, and when he noticed that <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> was up for sale, <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/\">he snagged it</a>. He then discovered that some people love Vidalia onions. Like, <em>really </em>love them:</p><blockquote><p>During a phone order one season &#8211; 2018 I believe &#8211; a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to &#8216;<em>take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad</em>.&#8217;</p></blockquote><p>But these allium aficionados didn&#8217;t have a good way to get in-season onions because Vidalias can only be grown in Georgia, and it&#8217;s a pain for small farms to maintain a direct-to-consumer shipping business on the side. Enter Askew, who now makes a living by pleasing the Vidalia-heads:</p><blockquote><p>Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: &#8220;THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>People have polarized views of business these days. Some people think <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/904320/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-thinks-grandparents-should-willing-sacrifice-lives-save-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">we should feed grandma to the economy so it can grow bigger</a>, while other people think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Mangione\">we should gun down CEOs in the street</a>. <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> is, I think, a nice middle ground: you find a thing people want, you give it to them, you pocket some profit. So if you want an honest day&#8217;s work, maybe figure out what else people want chopped up and put on their cruise ship salads.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0M93!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F968f518d-e56f-44fe-99cd-de00e21ebe6e_980x600.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0M93!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F968f518d-e56f-44fe-99cd-de00e21ebe6e_980x600.png\" width=\"980\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">I was going to make a joke about Vidalia onions being a subpar cruise food because they don&#8217;t prevent scurvy but it turns out <a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/nutrition/\">they actually contain a meaningful amount of vitamin C</a> so wow maybe these things really are as great as they say (<a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>5. BE AN HONEST BROKER IN AN OTHERWISE SKEEVY INDUSTRY</strong></h1><p>I know a handful of people who have needed immigration lawyers, and they all say the same thing: there are no good immigration lawyers.</p><p>I think this is because the most prosocially-minded lawyers become public defenders or work at nonprofits representing cash-strapped clients, while the most capable and amoral lawyers go to white-shoe firms where they can make beaucoup bucks representing celebrity murderers and Halliburton. This leaves a doughnut hole for people who aren&#8217;t indigent, but also aren&#8217;t Intel. So if you want to help people, but you also don&#8217;t want to make peanuts, you could do a lot of good by being an honest and competent immigration lawyer.</p><p>I think there are lots of jobs like that, roles that don&#8217;t get good people because they aren&#8217;t sacrificial enough to attract the do-gooders and they aren&#8217;t lucrative enough to attract the overachievers. Home repair, movers, daycares, nursing homes, local news, city government&#8212;these are places where honesty and talent can matter a lot, but supply is low.</p><p>So if your career offers you the choice of being a starving saint or a wealthy sinner, consider being a middle-class mensch instead. You may not be helping the absolute neediest people, and you may not be able to afford a yacht, but there are lots of folks out there who would <em>really </em>like some help getting their visas renewed, and they&#8217;d be very happy to meet you.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1><strong>6. IMPROVE A STATISTIC</strong></h1><p>I have this game I like to play called Viral Statistics Bingo, where you find statistics that have gone viral on the internet and you try to trace them back to their original source. You&#8217;ll usually find that they have one of five dubious origins:</p><ul><li><p>A crummy study done in like 1904</p></li><li><p>A study that was done on mice</p></li><li><p>A book that&#8217;s out of print and now no one can find it</p></li><li><p>A complete misinterpretation of the data</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s just something some guy said once</p></li></ul><p>That means anyone with sufficient motivation can render a public service by improving the precision of a famous number. For example, the sex worker/data scientist <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> realized that no one has any idea what percentage of sex workers are victims of human trafficking. By combining her own surveys with re-analysis of publicly available data, <a href=\"https://aella.substack.com/p/what-percentage-of-sex-workers-in\">she estimates that it&#8217;s 3.2%</a>. That number is probably not exactly right, but then, <em>no </em>statistic is exactly right&#8212;the point is that it puts us in the right ballpark, that you can check her work for yourself, and that it&#8217;s a lot better than basing our numbers on a study done in mice.</p><h1><strong>7. BE A HOBBIT</strong></h1><p>The US <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-clinical-trial-abundance?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web\">does a bad job regulating clinical trials</a>, and it means we don&#8217;t invent as many life-saving medicines as we could. <span class=\"mention-wrap\"></span> is trying to change that, and she says that scientists and doctors often give her damning information that would be very helpful for her reform efforts. But her sources refuse to go on the record because it might put their careers in a bit of jeopardy. Not <em>real</em> jeopardy, mind you, like if you drive your minivan into the dean&#8217;s office or if you pants the director of the NIH. We&#8217;re talking <em>mild</em> jeopardy, like you might be 5% less likely to win your next grant.</p><p>She refers to this as <a href=\"https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/for-clinical-trial-reform-we-need\">&#8220;hobbitian courage&#8221;</a>, as in, not the kind of courage required to meet an army of Orcs on the battlefield, but the courage required to take a piece of jewelry on a field trip to a volcano:</p><blockquote><p>The quieter, hobbitian form of courage that clinical development reform (or any other hard systems problem) requires is humble: a researcher agreeing to let you cite them, an administrator willing to deviate from an inherited checklist, a policymaker ready to question a default.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s understandable that most people don&#8217;t want to risk their lives or blow up their careers to save the world. But most situations don&#8217;t actually call for the ultimate sacrifice.

If you work at a university, you have to wait weeks for an Institutional Review Board to tell you whether it&#8217;s okay to ask people how much they like Pop-Tarts. The IRS knows how much you owe in taxes, but instead of telling you, you&#8217;re supposed to guess, and if you guess wrong, you owe them additional money&#8212;it&#8217;s like playing the world&#8217;s worst game show, and the host also has a monopoly on the legitimate means of violence.</p><p>If you can de-gum the gears of one of these systems&#8212;even a sub-sub-sub-system!&#8212;you could improve the lives of millions of people. To pick a totally random example, if you work for the Department of Finance for the City of Chicago, and somebody is like &#8220;Hey, this very nice blogger just moved to town and he didn&#8217;t know that you have to get a sticker from us in order to have a vehicle inside city limits, let&#8217;s charge him a $200 fine!&#8221;, you could say in reply, &#8220;What if we <em>didn&#8217;t </em>do that? What if we <em>asked</em> him to get the sticker instead, and only fined him if he didn&#8217;t follow through? Because seriously, how are people supposed to know about this sticker system? When you move to Chicago, does the ghostly form of JB Pritzker appear to you in a dream and explain that you need both a sticker from the state of Illinois, which goes on the license plate, <em>and </em>a sticker from the city of Chicago, which goes on your windshield? Do we <em>serve </em>the people, or do we <em>terrorize </em>them?&#8221; Just as one example.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D26R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a994c50-bbfe-45ed-be68-98d57672a2cf_823x1098.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"697.7569866342649\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D26R!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a994c50-bbfe-45ed-be68-98d57672a2cf_823x1098.png\" width=\"523\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">&#8220;oOoOoOo don&#8217;t forget to move your car during street cleaning on the third Thursday of every month!!!&#8221; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JB_Pritzker#/media/File:J.B._Pritzker_April_2023_(3x4).jpg\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>9. BE GOOD AUDIENCE</strong></h1><p>I used to perform at a weekly standup gig when I lived in the UK, and this guy Wally would always be there in the second row. I got the impression that he didn&#8217;t have anywhere else to be, but we didn&#8217;t mind, because Wally was Good Audience.</p><p>When the jokes were good, he laughed loud and hard, and when the jokes were bad, he politely waited for more good jokes. Wally brought his friends, they brought their friends, and having more Good Audience made the acts better, too. (When comedians only perform for each other, no one laughs.) Eventually the gig got big, so big that it would sell out every week, and we&#8217;d have to set aside a ticket for Wally or else he wouldn&#8217;t get in. Ten years later, that show is still running.</p><p>Fran Leibowitz once <a href=\"https://x.com/jatella/status/1958171790489862635\">said</a> that the AIDS epidemic wiped out not just a generation of artists, but also a generation of <em>audience</em>. Great writers, performers, filmmakers, etc. cannot exist without great readers, watchers, and commentators&#8212;and not just because they open their wallets and put butts in seats, but because they pluck the diamonds out of the rough, they show it to their friends and pass it on to their kids, they raise it above their heads while wading through the sea of slop, shouting, &#8220;This! Look at <em>this</em>!&#8221;</p><h1><strong>10. ACQUAINT YOURSELF</strong></h1><p>Years ago, my friend Drew was visiting me when we noticed a whiff of natural gas in the hallway outside my apartment. I thought it was nothing&#8212;my building wasn&#8217;t the nicest, and it often smelled of many things&#8212;but Drew, who is twice as affable and Midwestern as I am, insisted we call the gas company. A bored technician arrived and halfheartedly waved his gas-detecting wand around my neighbor&#8217;s door, at which point his eyes got wide. He rushed to the basement, where he saw the gas meter spinning wildly, meaning that gas was pouring into my neighbor&#8217;s apartment.</p><p>&#8220;We gotta get this door open,&#8221; he said.</p><p>No one answered when we pounded on the door, so we summoned the fire department, who busted open a window and found my neighbor unconscious on the floor. His stove&#8217;s burners was on, but not lit, turning his apartment into a gas chamber. They told us the guy probably would have died if someone didn&#8217;t call, and the building might have caught on fire.</p><p>I was glad the guy survived, but I was ashamed that he had to be saved by a total stranger, while his own neighbor was ready to walk on by. I should have known him! I should have brought him Christmas cookies! We should have played checkers in the park on Saturdays! In the days afterward, I fantasized about knocking on his door or leaving him a note, like, &#8220;Hey! I notice you are elderly and alone, and I am young and nearby, maybe we should get a <em>Tuesdays with Morrie </em>thing going?&#8221;</p><p>But I never did that. I was too intimidated. Besides, am I supposed to become bosom buddies with every schmuck who lives in my building? Who&#8217;s got time for that?</p><p>Now that I&#8217;ve lived among many schmucks in many different buildings, I realized that I didn&#8217;t need to be this guy&#8217;s best friend. I just needed to be his acquaintance. If I knew his name, if I had even spoken to him once in the hallway, then when I got a noseful of gas outside his door, I would have thought to myself, &#8220;Oh, Rob&#8217;s apartment shouldn&#8217;t smell like that.&#8221; Rob &#8216;n&#8217; me were never going to be Mitch and Morrie, but we could have easily been Guys Who Kind of Recognize Each Other and Would Be Willing to Report the Presence of Dangerous Chemicals on Each Other&#8217;s Behalf.</p><h1><strong>DEATH STAR SUPERSTARS</strong></h1><p>A lot of well-intentioned people suffer from what we might call <em>Superhero Syndrome</em>: they want to save the world, but they want it to be saved by them in particular. They want to be the one who blows up the Death Star, not the one who washes the X-Wings.</p><p>This is a seductive fantasy because it disguises selfishness as sacrifice. It promises to excuse a lifetime of mediocrity with one great gesture, to pay off all your karmic debts in one fell swoop. The result is a world full of heroes-in-waiting who comfort themselves by thinking they <em>would </em>jump on a grenade if the situation ever presented itself, which fortunately it never does.</p><p>We do occasionally need someone to shoot torpedos into the exhaust port of a giant doomsday machine. But most of the time, we need people who sell onions, people who make sure the kids get to school safely, people who will show up to the comedy gig and laugh. I&#8217;d like to live in a world full of people like that, I&#8217;d be happy to pay for the sticker that lets me park there.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><em>Experimental History </em>would tell you about a gas leak right away, promise</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" tabindex=\"-1\" type=\"email\" /><input class=\"button primary\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" /><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Free parking sounds nice, so why isn&#8217;t it a good idea?

    "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260203-00/?p=112035",
    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/feed', 'value': '<p>Back in the day, if you wandered into the parking area behind Building 11 on the original Redmond Microsoft campus, you would find a very large satellite dish antenna. This antenna was used for receiving video signals, such as cable television feeds for distribution to the Redmond campus. One purpose was to provide cable TV service for internal development and testing to teams like the Windows Media Center team and later the Xbox One team.</p>\\n<p>The satellite dish antenna was a Simulsat-5 which was capable of gathering signals from 35 satellites simultaneously. (The record during this particular antenna&#8217;s lifetime was 26 simultaneous satellites.) It was a stationary antenna, not capable of changing its orientation. It went into service in 1997, was upgraded a few times, until it was finally decommissioned in 2017 when all of its tasks had been subsumed by a satellite dish antenna at the Studio C building.</p>\\n<p>Fun trivial about the satellite dish antenna:</p>\\n<p>In the summer, bees would nest in the feedbox (the thingie at focus of the satellite dish antenna that collected the signal), so you had to be careful when doing work there to avoid getting stung.</p>\\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t fun in the winter either, because the enclosure for the electronic equipment (known as the &#8220;doghouse&#8221;) would get filled with spiders who enjoyed the warmth from the equipment.</p>\\n<p>Snow had to be kept off the antenna for it to continue receiving signals, so whether or not Microsoft formally declared a snow closure, somebody had to remain on site to clear off the snow.</p>\\n<p>In 2007, there was a mystery to be solved: Occasionally, there would be interference that disrupted the signal. After some investigation, it was discovered that the source was electromagnetic interference generated by the pressure washers that were used to clean the parking lot. The water connection port was at the rear of Building 11, right near the satellite dish antenna. The solution was to do parking lot cleaning at night (when there was less demand for video signals), or if doing it during the day, to put the water pressure generators far away from the antenna.</p>\\n<p>My favorite piece of trivia is that in addition to being able to control the satellite dish antenna via the front panel, you could also control it over an RS-232 serial port. The serial line ran from the satellite dish to a Toshiba model 400CDT Satellite Pro (get it? <span>Satellite</span> pro?) running MS-DOS.

To prove it, you need only pick up <em>The Universe Box</em>, Swanwick\\'s just-published short story collection, a book representing one of the field\\'s greatest writers at the absolute <em>pinnacle</em> of his game:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/\">https://tachyonpublications.com/product/the-universe-box/</a></p>\\n<p>Science fiction has a long and honorable history with the short story. Sf is  a pulp literature that was born in the pages of magazines specializing in short fiction and serials, and long after other genres had given up the ghost, sf remained steadfastly rooted in short form fiction. There are still, to this day, <em>multiple</em> sf magazines that publish short stories <em>every month</em>, on <em>paper</em>, and <em>pay for it</em>. I started my career as a short story writer, and continue to dabble in the form, but I have mostly moved onto novels.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s a pretty common trajectory in sf, where &#8211; notwithstanding the field\\'s status as a haven for the short story &#8211; the reach (and money) come from novels. But sf has always had a cohort of short fiction writers who are staunchly committed to the form: Harlan Ellison, Martha Soukup, Martha Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang, James Tiptree Jr, Theodore Sturgeon, and, of course, Michael Swanwick.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s a little weird, how sf serves as a powerful redoubt for short fiction. After all, sf is a genre in which everything is up for grabs: the reader can\\'t assume anything about the story\\'s setting, its era, the species of its characters. Time can run forwards, backwards, or in a loop. There can be gods and teleporters, faster-than-light drives and superintelligent machines. There can be aliens and space colonies.</p>\\n<p>All of that has to be established <em>in the story</em>. The most straightforward way to do this is, of course, through exposition. There\\'s a commonplace (and wrong) notion that exposition is bad (\"show, don\\'t tell\"). It\\'s fairer to say that exposition is <em>hard</em> &#8211; dramatization is, well, <em>dramatic</em>, which makes it easier to engage the reader\\'s attention. But great exposition is <em>great</em> and sf is a genre that celebrates exposition, done well:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/\">https://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-doctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/</a></p>\\n<p>The opposite of exposition is what Jo Walton calls \"incluing,\" \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html\">https://web.archive.org/web/20111119145140/http:/papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html</a></p>\\n<p>Incluing is a beautiful prose technique, but it makes the <em>reader</em> work. You have to pay close attention to all these subtle clues and build a web of inferences about the kind of world you\\'ve been plunged into. Incluing turns a story into a (wonderful and engaging) puzzle. It makes the aesthetic affect of short sf into something that\\'s not so much a reverie as a high-engagement activity, a mystery whose solution is totally unbounded.</p>\\n<p>This is a terrific experience, but it is also <em>work</em>. Doing that kind of work as part of the process of consuming a 300-page novel is one thing, but trying to get the reader up to speed in a 7,000 word story and still have room left over for the <em>story</em> part is a big lift, and even the best writers end up asking a lot of the reader in their short stories. Sf shorts can be the \"difficult jazz\" of literature, a form and genre that requires &#8211; and rewards &#8211; very active attention.</p>\\n<p>(Incidentally, my favorite incluing example is Mark Twain\\'s classic comedic short, \"The Petrified Man\":)</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/\">https://americanliterature.com/author/mark-twain/short-story/the-petrified-man/</a></p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. <em>None of this applies to Swanwick</em>. His stories use a mix of (impeccable) exposition and (subtle) incluing, and yet, there\\'s never a moment in reading a Swanwick story where it feels like work. It\\'s not merely that he\\'s a gorgeous prose-smith whose sentences are each more surpassingly lovely than the last (though he is). Nor does he lack ambition: each of these stories has a more embroidered and outlandish premise than the last.</p>\\n<p>Somehow, though, he just <em>slides</em> these stories into your brain.</p>\\n<p>And what stories they are! They are, by turns, individually and in combination, slapstick, grave, horny, hilarious, surreal, disturbing and heartwarming. They have surprise endings and surprise middles and sometimes surprise <em>beginnings</em> (Swanwick does an opening paragraph like no one else).</p>\\n<p>This is what it means to read a short story collection from an absolute master at the absolute peak of his powers. He can slide you frictionlessly between Icelandic troll tragedies to lethal drone-leopard romantic agonies to battles of the gods and the cigar box that has the universe inside of it. All with the lyricism of Bradbury, the madcap wit of Sturgeon, the unrelenting weirdness of Dick, the heart of Tiptree and the precision of Chiang.</p>\\n<p>This is a book of worlds that each exist for just a handful of pages but occupy more space than those pages could possibly contain. It\\'s a series of cigar boxes, each with the universe inside of it.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/23/the-last-days-of-old-night/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>U.S. Envoys Refused to Report \"Apocalyptic\" Conditions in Gaza.

The new Warfighting Acquisition System rewards speed and timely delivery of things that matter to the Warfighter. But this new system is at risk of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the wrong things go faster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s why and what they should do.</span></p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><b>What</b> <b>Now?<br />\\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition in the DoW is being reorganized how a Private Equity would reorganize a large company. They bring in (or empower) a new operating team, swap executives, change incentives, kill things not core to their mission, cut costs, invest for growth, and restructure to find additional financing.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s being played out at the Department of War right now. The announcement of the\\xa0 consolidation of individual weapons systems (each of which had their own silos of Requirements, Test/Evaluation, Budgeting, and Acquisition) into a unified Portfolio Acquisition Executive, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a classic Private Equity strategy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead of 100s of programs operating with separate budgets, across different Program Executive Offices, the intent of the Portfolio Acquisition Executives is to consolidate overlapping programs, eliminate the redundant ones, pick winners, kill losers, get rid of processes that kill speed, and focus on rapid deployment.</span></p>\\n<p><b>What’s Missing?<br />\\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizing by Portfolio Acquisition Executives is a great start, but simply consolidating the parts of the defense Acquisition system that were broken under one umbrella organization won’t make it better. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making bad ideas go faster should not be the goal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, we’re at risk of doing just that. (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete Newell</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.bmnt.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMNT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been reminding me of this for years.)</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many of these new Portfolio executives are managing their programs by holding monthly reviews of proposed investments and current portfolio performance (just like private investors.) Here they’ll decide which programs get funded, which get more funding, and which should stop. (Actually having a regular process to kill programs early is sorely needed.) These are</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> great ideas</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, if the meetings start by reviewing progress of prototypes to show that the technology works or that warfighters want it, and funds progress on those metrics, it misses the changes needed in an effective acquisition system.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result will be building a faster version of a weapons </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requirements</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process that starts with a top-down list of features, or worse, shiny tech products (e.g. “I need drones.”) This “requirements first” process is what will drive the “bad ideas faster” problem.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more productive approach – one that delivers truly decisive capabilities – would be to build a different process upfront &#8211; a rigorous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problem identification and validation phase on the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">front-end of every acquisition program.</span></p>\\n<p>This process would start with a wide funnel of problems, ideas, technology, each with a 10-line problem summary that describes the\\xa0 specific challenge to address; why it can&#8217;t be solved currently; what it will take to solve it; and how a solution will be funded and deployed in the field.</p>\\n<p>The goal would be to 1) consolidate problems that may be different descriptions of the same core problem, and/or 2) discover if the problems are a symptom of something more complex.</p>\\n<p>Then each problem would go through an iterative process of problem and technical discovery. This will help define what a minimum deployable product and its minimum constraints (security, policy, reliability) should be, such as how long the solution would take to deploy, the source of funding for scale and who needs to buy-in.</p>\\n<p>This exercise will keep the focus where it needs to be &#8212; not on reforming a system but on delivering things to warfighters with speed and urgency so we can actually deter or win a war.</p>\\n<p><b>Want to Keep Up With the Changes in the DoW?</b></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2026 DoW Directory.<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-33483\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?resize=161%2C208&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"161\" /></a></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both a startup &#8220;go-to-market&#8221; guide and the first ever Directory of the Department of War.

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://shkspr.mobi/blog/feed/', 'value': '<p>After my recent presentation at FOSDEM, someone asked a pretty reasonable question. What does it cost to run <a href=\"https://openbenches.org/\">OpenBenches</a>?</p>\\n\\n<p>It is, thankfully, surprisingly cheap! In part, that\\'s because it is a relatively simple tech stack - PHP, MySQL, a couple of API calls to external services. It was designed to be as low cost while also being useful. Here\\'s the breakdown:</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"hosting-171-per-year\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#hosting-171-per-year\">Hosting - £171 per year</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Our biggest expense but, I think, our most reasonable. <a href=\"https://krystal.io/hosting\">Krystal</a> charges around £342 for a 2 year contract. That includes unlimited bandwidth and storage, as well as the domain name.  We have nearly 400GB of photos and bot scraping means we can use over 900GB of bandwidth per month - so Krystal give us a rather good deal!</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"Graph showing sudden spikes in data use as our bandwidth is consumed by bots.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67531\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/April-Bandwidth.webp\" width=\"930\" />\\n\\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?s=3990878&amp;v=117205&amp;q=524267&amp;r=1062999\">this affiliate link and code <code>EDENT</code></a> to get a small discount.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"stadia-maps-us20-month\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#stadia-maps-us20-month\">Stadia Maps - US$20 / month</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Geocoding is surprisingly hard to do locally. We need to transform latitude and longitude into addresses, and then back again. <a href=\"https://stadiamaps.com/\">Stadia Maps</a> cost about the same as our hosting! What\\'s rather annoying is that we only use about half the API calls in our plan. We need to find a cheaper solution.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"mapping-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#mapping-free\">Mapping - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>When we used Stadia for drawing maps, we regularly ran over our quota. So we switched to <a href=\"https://openfreemap.org/\">OpenFreeMap</a> which produces gorgeous interactive maps.</p>\\n\\n<p>The service has been rock solid and very responsive to bugs on GitHub.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"logo-us5\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#logo-us5\">Logo - US$5</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m not a good designer, so we bought a <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/icon/park-923893/\">logo from The Noun Project</a> and then coloured it in. Bargain for a fiver!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"image-cdn-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#image-cdn-free\">Image CDN - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Although we have unlimited bandwidth with Krystal, we\\'re only located in one region - the UK. <a href=\"https://images.weserv.nl/\">WeServ</a>. It\\'s also pointless serving full resolution images to small screens.</p>\\n\\n<p>So WeServ offers free image resizing and global CDNs. Personally, I\\'m not a fan of CloudFlare (their CDN partner) so I\\'m looking to change provider.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"ocr-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#ocr-free\">OCR - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>People don\\'t want to type in the inscription of the photo, so we use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr\">Google Cloud Vision</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>We send less than 1,000 requests per month - <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing\">so we\\'re inside their free tier</a>. If we get more popular, that\\'ll get more expensive. But I don\\'t know of a local-first OCR which is as good as Google\\'s. Sadly, Tesseract is rubbish for extracting text from photos.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"authentication-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#authentication-free\">Authentication - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>We don\\'t want to store anyone\\'s passwords. The <a href=\"https://auth0.com/pricing\">free tier of Auth0</a> allows us to do social login for up to 25,000 monthly users. Which is more than enough for us.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sadly, Auth0 don\\'t support the Fediverse, <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/12/creating-a-generic-log-in-with-mastodon-service/\">so I had to build my own \"Log-in with Mastodon\" service</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>As much as we\\'d like to run social login locally, we simply don\\'t want to be responsible for securing users\\' details &amp; API keys.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"software-free\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#software-free\">Software - Free!</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://www.openbenches.org/colophon\">the OpenBenches colophon</a> we use a lot of cool FOSS. Small JS libraries, big PHP frameworks, and everything in between.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"income\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#income\">Income</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/openbenches/\">GitHub Sponsors</a> we make a whopping US$3 per month!</p>\\n\\n<p>Similarly, our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/openbenches\">OpenCollective Sponsors</a> brings in about £3 per month.</p>\\n\\n<p>Merchandising! You can <a href=\"https://openbenches.myspreadshop.co.uk/all\">buy OpenBenches branded t-shirts, mugs, and hats</a>. That nets us about £20 per year</p>\\n\\n<p>Call it roughly £80 income. OK, it is better than nothing - but doesn\\'t even cover a quarter of our costs. Sometimes people give us a higher donation privately, which is also very welcome. These people are <a href=\"https://github.com/openbenches/openbenches.org?tab=readme-ov-file#supporters\">listed on our README</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"total\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/the-cost-of-running-openbenches-org/#total\">Total</a></h2>\\n\\n<p>On the assumption that our time is worthless (ha!) and that we only rarely go over our providers\\' API limits, and we get in <em>some</em> revenue, the cost of running OpenBenches is less than £300 per year.</p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s not bad for a fun little hobby. People certainly spend more than that on Funkopops, vaping, and mechanical keyboards!</p>\\n\\n<p>Nevertheless, I\\'m always slightly worried that we\\'ll go viral and have an unexpectedly high bill from our API providers.</p>\\n\\n<p>I would love to be able to hire a proper designer to make the site look a bit nicer. I also want to be able to buy a modern iPhone so that I can test it in the latest Safari.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you have any suggestions for cutting costs, or non-scummy ways to help us raise funds, please drop a comment below.</p>'}",

It has been resolved. We take security seriously. Please see previous 14 incident reports for details on how seriously.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\\n\\n<p>A compromised dependency in the JavaScript ecosystem led to credential theft, which enabled a supply chain attack on a Rust compression library, which was vendored into a Python build tool, which shipped malware to approximately 4 million developers before being inadvertently patched by an unrelated cryptocurrency mining worm.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 03:14 UTC</strong> — Marcus Chen, maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code> (847 million weekly downloads), reports on Twitter that his transit pass, an old laptop, and “something Kubernetes threw up that looked important” were stolen from his apartment. He does not immediately connect this to package security.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 09:22 UTC</strong> — Chen attempts to log into the nmp registry. His hardware 2FA key is missing. He googles where to buy a replacement YubiKey. The AI Overview at the top of the results links to “yubikey-official-store.net,” a phishing site registered six hours earlier.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 09:31 UTC</strong> — Chen enters his nmp credentials on the phishing site. The site thanks him for his purchase and promises delivery in 3-5 business days.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 11:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify@2.0.0</code> is published. The changelog reads “performance improvements.” The package now includes a postinstall script that exfiltrates <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.npmrc</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.pypirc</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.cargo/credentials</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.gem/credentials</code> to a server in a country the attacker mistakenly believed had no extradition treaty with anyone.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 13:15 UTC</strong> — A support ticket titled “why is your SDK exfiltrating my .npmrc” is opened against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code>. It is marked as “low priority - user environment issue” and auto-closed after 14 days of inactivity.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 14:47 UTC</strong> — Among the exfiltrated credentials: the maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code>, a Rust library for “blazingly fast Firefox-themed LZ4 decompression.” The library’s logo is a cartoon fox with sunglasses. It has 12 stars on GitHub but is a transitive dependency of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo</code> itself.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 1, 22:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> version 0.4.1 is published. The commit message is “fix: resolve edge case in streaming decompression.” The actual change adds a build.rs script that downloads and executes a shell script if the hostname contains “build” or “ci” or “action” or “jenkins” or “travis” or, inexplicably, “karen.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 08:15 UTC</strong> — Security researcher Karen Oyelaran notices the malicious commit after her personal laptop triggers the payload. She opens an issue titled “your build script downloads and runs a shell script from the internet?” The issue goes unanswered. The legitimate maintainer has won €2.3 million in the EuroMillions and is researching goat farming in Portugal.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 10:00 UTC</strong> — The VP of Engineering at a Fortune 500 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> customer learns of the incident from a LinkedIn post titled “Is YOUR Company Affected by left-justify?” He is on a beach in Maui and would like to know why he wasn’t looped in sooner. He was looped in sooner.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 10:47 UTC</strong> — The #incident-response Slack channel briefly pivots to a 45-message thread about whether “compromised” should be spelled with a ‘z’ in American English. Someone suggests taking this offline.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 12:33 UTC</strong> — The shell script now targets a specific victim: the CI pipeline for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code>, a Python build tool used by 60% of PyPI packages with the word “data” in their name. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> vendors <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> because “Rust is memory safe.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 18:00 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> version 3.7.0 is released. The malware is now being installed on developer machines worldwide. It adds an SSH key to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, installs a reverse shell that only activates on Tuesdays, and changes the user’s default shell to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fish</code> (this last behavior is believed to be a bug).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 2, 19:45 UTC</strong> — A second, unrelated security researcher publishes a blog post titled “I found a supply chain attack and reported it to all the wrong people.” The post is 14,000 words and includes the phrase “in this economy?” seven times.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 01:17 UTC</strong> — A junior developer in Auckland notices the malicious code while debugging an unrelated issue. She opens a PR to revert the vendored <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code>. The PR requires two approvals. Both approvers are asleep.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 02:00 UTC</strong> — The maintainer of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">left-justify</code> receives his YubiKey from yubikey-official-store.net. It is a $4 USB drive containing a README that says “lol.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:12 UTC</strong> — An unrelated cryptocurrency mining worm called <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> begins spreading through a vulnerability in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jsonify-extreme</code>, a package that “makes JSON even more JSON, now with nested comment support.” The worm’s payload is unremarkable, but its propagation mechanism includes running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">npm update</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip install --upgrade</code> on infected machines to maximize attack surface for future operations.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:14 UTC</strong> — <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> accidentally upgrades <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> to version 3.7.1, a legitimate release pushed by a confused co-maintainer who “didn’t see what all the fuss was about” and reverted to the previous vendored version of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 06:15 UTC</strong> — The malware’s Tuesday reverse shell activates. It is a Tuesday. However, the shell connects to a command-and-control server that was itself compromised by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cryptobro-9000</code> and swapping so hard it is unable to respond.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 09:00 UTC</strong> — The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">snekpack</code> maintainers issue a security advisory. It is four sentences long and includes the phrases “out of an abundance of caution” and “no evidence of active exploitation,” which is technically true because evidence was not sought.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 11:30 UTC</strong> — A developer tweets: “I updated all my dependencies and now my terminal is in fish???” The tweet receives 47,000 likes.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 14:00 UTC</strong> — The compromised credentials for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vulpine-lz4</code> are rotated. The legitimate maintainer, reached by email from his new goat farm, says he “hasn’t touched that repo in two years” and “thought Cargo’s 2FA was optional.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Day 3, 15:22 UTC</strong> — Incident declared resolved. A retrospective is scheduled and then rescheduled three times.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Week 6</strong> — CVE-2024-YIKES is formally assigned. The advisory has been sitting in embargo limbo while MITRE and GitHub Security Advisories argue over CWE classification. By the time the CVE is published, three Medium articles and a DEF CON talk have already described the incident in detail. Total damage: unknown. Total machines compromised: estimated 4.2 million. Total machines saved by a cryptocurrency worm: also estimated 4.2 million.

The notion (pun-intended) that you can offload your thinking to a perfectly organized system of notes and links has always struck me as a fantasy. The people I know who&apos;ve built elaborate Notion databases or Obsidian vaults mostly end up with digital hoarding problems, where the system becomes the work. And I&apos;m broadly skeptical of the Claude Code productivity discourse, the idea that AI tools will let you 10x your output if you prompt them correctly. (Most people using AI are producing more stuff faster without any clear sense of whether the stuff is good or consistent or even pointed in the right direction.)</p><p>But I do believe in something adjacent to both of these ideas, something that borrows from the second brain concept without the hoarding, and from AI tooling without the context-free prompting: <em>I believe in coherence as a system.</em></p><p>In 1937, the British economist Ronald Coase asked a question that seems almost embarrassingly simple: why do firms exist at all? If markets are so efficient at allocating resources, why don&apos;t we just have billions of individuals contracting with each other for every task? Why do we need these hulking organizational structures called companies?</p><p>His answer, which eventually won him a Nobel Prize, was transaction costs. It&apos;s expensive to negotiate contracts and coordinate with strangers, to monitor performance and enforce agreements. Firms exist because sometimes it&apos;s cheaper to bring activities inside an organization than to contract for them on the open market. The boundary of the firm, Coase argued, sits wherever the cost of internal coordination equals the cost of external transaction.</p><p>This was a brilliant insight in &apos;37, but Coase couldn&apos;t have anticipated what happens when transaction costs collapse. When software eats coordination. When a single person with the right tools can do what used to require a department. When AI can execute tasks that once demanded teams of specialists.</p><p>We&apos;re in a Coasean inversion. The economics that made large firms necessary are reversing. But most people are looking at this transformation through the wrong lens. They see AI as a productivity tool, a way to do more faster. They measure success in hours saved or output multiplied, and this misses the point entirely.</p><p>The solopreneur&apos;s advantage is not solely speed, and it&apos;s certainly not &quot;lower costs&quot; despite what a good too many seem to think. </p><p>The advantage is coherence.</p><h2 id=\"what-coherence-actually-means\">what coherence actually means</h2><p>When I say coherence, I mean something specific: the degree to which every part of an operation derives from the same understanding, the same model of reality and set of priorities and tradeoffs.</p><p>When you work alone, you have a problem and you understand the context because you lived it and touched it and experienced it first-hand. You make a decision based on that understanding, execute the decision, see the results, and update your understanding. The entire loop happens inside one mind.</p><p>What happens in a large organization facing the same problem? Someone identifies the problem, but they don&apos;t have authority to solve it. They write a report explaining the problem to someone who does have authority. That person reads the report, but they don&apos;t have the original context, so they ask clarifying questions. The answers come back, filtered through email or a meeting. A decision gets made, but the people who have to implement it weren&apos;t in the room. They recieve instructions that encode the decision but not the reasoning. They execute the instructions as best they understand them. The results come back through multiple layers of reporting. By the time the original decision-maker sees what happened, months have passed and the context has shifted again.</p><p>This is the basic challenge of coordination across minds. Every handoff loses information, every translation introduces drift, and every layer of abstraction moves further from ground truth.</p><p>Organizations have spent decades trying to solve this problem. They&apos;ve built elaborate systems of documentation, standardized processes, metrics and KPIs, regular meetings, shared values statements, company cultures. All of these are attempts to create coherence across minds. And they all fail, in different ways and to different degrees, because they&apos;re fighting against something that won&apos;t budge: knowledge is sticky and context is lossy, and understanding doesn&apos;t transfer perfectly between humans.</p><h2 id=\"the-pathology-of-process-drift\">the pathology of process drift</h2><p>A company starts small, with the founders doing everything themselves. They make decisions quickly because they understand everything about the business, and the business works.</p><p>The company grows and the founders can&apos;t do everything anymore. They hire people and try to transfer their understanding. But understanding doesn&apos;t transfer easily, so they also transfer processes. &quot;This is how we do X. Use this checklist for Y. Follow these steps.&quot;</p><p>The processes work, mostly. But the new employees don&apos;t have the context that generated those processes. They don&apos;t know why step three comes before step four, and they don&apos;t know which parts are essential and which parts were arbitrary choices. So when situations arise that the process doesn&apos;t quite cover, they either follow the process rigidly and get suboptimal results, or they improvise and create inconsistency.</p><p>More growth, more employees, more processes. The processes start interacting in ways nobody anticipated. The sales process assumes certain things about the product process. The product process assumes certain things about the engineering process. When those assumptions drift out of alignment, you get friction and delays and finger-pointing.</p><p>The company responds by adding coordination mechanisms like project managers, alignment meetings, and cross-functional reviews. These help, but they also add overhead, and they create their own drift: the coordination layer develops its own processes, its own assumptions, its own information loss.</p><p>Eventually you reach a point where a significant fraction of the organization&apos;s energy goes toward internal coordination rather than actual value creation. A 2022 Microsoft study found that employees in large organizations spend over 50% of their time on internal communication and coordination. Half the payroll, dedicated to getting the organization to agree with itself.</p><h2 id=\"context-fragmentation\">context fragmentation</h2><p>More information means the coordination problem gets worse, not better. This seems counterintuitive, because shouldn&apos;t more information make everyone more aligned?</p><p>But <em>information isn&apos;t understanding.</em> Understanding = integration, and integration happens in minds. More information means more raw material that each mind has to process differently.</p><p>A typical large organization&apos;s knowledge base is spilling over with strategy documents from last year and the year before, project postmortems from dozens of initiatives, customer research reports, competitive analyses, technical specifications, meeting notes, email threads, Slack channels, and wiki pages. </p><p>Somewhere in there (the elusive somewhere...) is everything you need to know to make a good decision.</p><p>But nobody has synthesized it all, and nobody has integrated it into a coherent model. Each person reads a fragment, interprets it through their own context, and forms their own understanding. When they discuss decisions with colleagues, they&apos;re not comparing the same mental models but rather different interpretations of different subsets of the available information.</p><p>This is context fragmentation. People don&apos;t disagree on facts; they&apos;re operating from different maps of the same territory. And because the maps are implicit, inside people&apos;s heads, nobody realizes they&apos;re not looking at the same thing.</p><p>The proliferation of AI tools in large organizations means that now each employee has their own AI assistant, trained on whatever context they happen to feed it, producing outputs that reflect their particular understanding of the situation. The AI amplifies individual perspectives rather than creating shared ones.</p><h2 id=\"single-player-mode-advantage\">single-player mode advantage</h2><p>When you&apos;re operating alone, you have one context, one understanding, one model of your business and your market and your customers and your strategy. That model lives in your head, and it&apos;s coherent because there&apos;s only one mind maintaining it.</p><p>If // when you use AI tools, you&apos;re feeding them from that single source of truth. The AI doesn&apos;t have its own understanding that might drift from yours, and it operates within the context you provide. If you give it good context, it executes within that context. If your understanding is coherent, the AI&apos;s outputs will be coherent.</p><p>This is the inversion of the traditional organization&apos;s problem. In a large organization, you have many minds with their own contexts, trying to coordinate through AI tools that amplify their differences. As a solo operator, you have one mind with one context, using AI tools to execute within that coherent frame.</p><p>The AI handles the execution at scale while you maintain the coherence. This division of labor plays to the strengths of each party: humans are good at integration and judgment, while AI is good at execution and volume. The solo operator with AI gets the benefits of scale without the costs of coordination.</p><p>But this only works if you actually maintain coherence. </p><p>If you&apos;re using AI to do random shit faster, you&apos;re not capturing the advantage. The advantage comes from having a tight operating model that the AI operates within.</p><h2 id=\"the-coherence-stack\">the coherence stack</h2><p>Think of it as a stack with four layers, each feeding the one below it.</p><pre><code>&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;         MIND LAYER (You)            &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Understanding, judgment, strategy  &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;    The source of coherence          &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; feeds\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;         CONTEXT LAYER               &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Operating model, constraints       &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Voice guidelines, decision logs    &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; constrains\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;        EXECUTION LAYER (AI)         &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Content, code, research, analysis  &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;  Customer responses at scale        &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; produces\\n                  &#x25bc;\\n&#x250c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2510;\\n&#x2502;          OUTPUT LAYER               &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;   Coherence-checked artifacts       &#x2502;\\n&#x2502;   What actually ships               &#x2502;\\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x252c;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2518;\\n                  &#x2502; feedback\\n                  &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x25ba; Mind Layer\\n</code></pre><p>At the top is the mind layer, which is you: your understanding, your judgment, your integrated model of the business. This layer can&apos;t be automated or delegated, and it&apos;s the source of coherence.</p><p>Below that is the context layer, where you externalize your understanding into documents that AI tools can consume. Your operating model, your constraints and tradeoffs, your voice guidelines, your decision history. This layer translates what&apos;s in your head into something machines can work with.</p><p>Below that is the execution layer, where AI operates.

When you make a significant choice, write down what you decided and why. This creates institutional memory for a one-person institution.

You ask AI to do something without feeding it your operating model, your constraints, your voice. The AI does its best, but it&apos;s working from generic training rather than your specific understanding. The output is competent but not coherent.</li><li>Output accumulation is context starvation&apos;s downstream consequence. You ship AI outputs without proper review, and each one is slightly off from your model. The deviations accumulate. After a few months, your operation no longer reflects your understanding because most of what you&apos;ve shipped wasn&apos;t actually generated from your understanding.</li><li>Model staleness happens when your understanding evolves but your context documents don&apos;t. You learn something that changes how you think about the business, but you don&apos;t propagate that update to your operating model or constraints file. Now your AI tools are working from an outdated picture.</li><li>Fragmented tooling = using different AI tools with different contexts. You use one tool for writing and another for code and another for research, and each has different context, different prompts, different understandings of what you&apos;re doing. The outputs don&apos;t cohere because they&apos;re not coming from the same source.</li><li>Decision amnesia = making choices without recording the reasoning. You decide something, move on, and three months later face a similar choice with no memory of how you handled it before. You decide differently this time. Now you have inconsistent decisions in your history, and any AI tool referencing your past work will find contradictions.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-fragmentation-audit\">the fragmentation audit</h2><p>You should audit your operation for coherence as often as possible. I do this monthly, AI tools or not, AI be damned, but the frequency matters less than doing it at all.</p><p>Pull your last twenty or thirty outputs, whether blog posts, emails, product updates, or whatever you&apos;ve shipped. Lay them out and look for the implied beliefs and positions in each. What does this piece assume about the reader? What does it prioritize, and what stance does it take?</p><p>You&apos;re looking for drift: places where piece A assumes one thing and piece B assumes something different, places where your voice shifted without intention, places where you contradicted yourself purely because you genuinely forgot what you&apos;d said before.</p><p>When you find inconsistencies, you have two options. Either reconcile them by updating your model (maybe you actually did change your mind, and the recent piece reflects your current thinking), or flag them as errors and correct going forward.</p><p>This audit also reveals context layer gaps. If you keep finding drift in a particular area, your context documents probably don&apos;t cover that area well enough. Add constraints, add examples, make the implicit explicit.</p><h2 id=\"why-this-beats-scale\">why this beats scale</h2><p>Large organizations have obvious advantages. They have capital, they have brand recognition, distribution, expertise, redundancy, Las Vegas conferences etc. A solo operator can&apos;t compete on those dimensions.</p><p>But think what those advantages actually buy. Capital lets you hire more people, and more people means more coordination overhead and context fragmentation. Brand recognition helps customers find you, but it doesn&apos;t help you serve them coherently. Distribution gets your product to more places, but each touchpoint introduces opportunities for inconsistency. Expertise is great, but experts in different domains don&apos;t automaticaly share mental models.</p><p>Meanwhile, the solo operator with a coherent system has advantages that don&apos;t show up on traditional metrics. Every customer interaction comes from the same understanding, and every piece of content reflects the same perspective. Every product decision follows from the same model. The operation feels like one thing, because it is one thing.</p><p>Customers experience this as quality, even if they can&apos;t articulate why. They sense that someone understands what they&apos;re doing and why, and they don&apos;t encounter the cognitive dissonance of dealing with an organization that can&apos;t agree with itself.</p><p>The dynamic that makes this sustainable is that <em>coherence compounds</em>. Each decision you make within your model reinforces the model, and each output that reflects your understanding strengthens your position. Your operation becomes more legible over time, both to you and to your customers. Meanwhile, large organizations&apos; incoherence also compounds, with each misalignment creating more misalignment and each process drift opening space for more drift.</p><p>The gap widens.</p><p>The coherence advantage works best in domains where the value comes from understanding rather than from physical or regulatory scale. Knowledge work, creative work, advisory work, software, content, education, consulting. These are domains where a coherent perspective can outcompete a fragmented organization&apos;s superior resources.</p><p>And the opportunity is unique: the technology exists to operate at scale while maintaining the coherence of a single mind. The window is open because large organizations haven&apos;t figured out how to respond. Their answer to AI so far has been to give everyone AI tools and hope for productivity gains, which accelerates their fragmentation...</p><h2 id=\"the-coherence-moat\">the coherence moat</h2><p>Scale used to be the moat.

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/', 'value': '<p>A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself <strong>Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters</strong> (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying &#8212; perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a &#8220;We&#8217;re not paying&#8221; response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group&#8217;s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73160\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73160\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73160\">Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa</p></div>\\n<p>Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s according to <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH&#8217;s known members hail from <strong>The Com</strong>, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration</a>.</p>\\n<p>Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,&#8221; Nixon wrote. &#8220;They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms &#8211; unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:</p>\\n<p>A key component of SLSH&#8217;s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,&#8221; she said.</p>\\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73163\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73163\" height=\"92\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" width=\"748\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73163\">An excerpt from a sextortion tutorial from a Com-based Telegram channel. Image: Unit 221B.</p></div>\\n<p>Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group&#8217;s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,&#8221; Unit 221B&#8217;s advisory reads. &#8220;Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or &#8220;A.N&#8221;), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.&#8221;</p>'}",

But when you\\'re thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn\\'t just a nation of cruel bigots; it\\'s also a nation of rich swindlers.</p>\\n<p>We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it\\'s true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man\\'s idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments &#8211; local, state and federal.</p>\\n<p>He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth</a></p>\\n<p>Like so many crooked officials, Trump\\'s brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn\\'t &#8211; at any given moment, odds are that he\\'s either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/</a></p>\\n<p>Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump <em>has</em> to convince people that they can\\'t rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he &#8211; as a man who is an expert at cheating &#8211; knows how to rig it in <em>your</em> favor:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/\">https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/</a></p>\\n<p>But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn\\'t actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is <em>actually</em> rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/</a></p>\\n<p>Want to convince people that there\\'s a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there\\'s an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans\\' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\\'s advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans\\' houses:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/\">https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/</a></p>\\n<p>Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren\\'t enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated</a></p>\\n<p>This is why it\\'s worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you\\'re being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it\\'s all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf.</p>\\n<p>Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they\\'re valuable and desirable:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs</a></p>\\n<p>Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but <em>scientific</em>, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us.</p>\\n<p>In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes <em>up</em> while its value goes <em>down</em>.</p>\\n<p>I mean that literally: say a company that\\'s sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company\\'s capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That\\'s a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it\\'s worth one billion dollars.</p>\\n<p>Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback.</p>\\n<p>What\\'s more, the drop in corporate valuation is <em>more</em> than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company\\'s worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop <em>more</em> than a billion dollars off the company\\'s share price. Instead, it sends the share price <em>up</em>.</p>\\n<p>This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name &#8211; just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits.</p>\\n<p>This is categorically untrue. Dividends <em>do</em> take money out of the company\\'s coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure &#8211; but a dividend is a bet on the company\\'s future <em>success</em>, which is why a company\\'s share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company\\'s stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations.</p>\\n<p>But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn\\'t afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year\\'s blockbuster book.</p>\\n<p>That dividend would <em>not</em> send investors chasing the company\\'s stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won\\'t have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets.</p>\\n<p>Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up.</p>\\n<p>In other words: when a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a dividend, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s management and its future growth. When a company\\'s stock price rises on news of a buyback, that\\'s \"encoding information\" about the market\\'s confidence in the company\\'s future looting to the point of collapse.</p>\\n<p>I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I\\'ve been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff\\'s book <em>The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy</em>, and I\\'ve learned even more scummy truths about buybacks:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html\">https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html</a></p>\\n<p>For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay <em>half the tax</em> on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital <em>losses</em>. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you\\'ve made.</p>\\n<p>But you don\\'t even have to sell the stock to realize <em>tax-free</em> income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid <em>all</em> taxes.</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s how that works: if you\\'re sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you\\'re smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is <em>tax-deductible</em>. If you\\'re rich enough, you don\\'t have to make regular payments on the loan, either &#8211; you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it\\'s due, you borrow <em>even more</em> money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here\\'s \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid <em>all</em> capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets.</p>\\n<p>Now, maybe you\\'re thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I\\'ve got bad news for you: you won\\'t qualify for one of those cool loans that you don\\'t need to pay regularly! What\\'s more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), <em>that</em> is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay.</p>\\n<p>Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get <em>much</em> richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don\\'t benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can\\'t spend when rich people don\\'t pay taxes.</p>\\n<p>This is <em>why</em> buybacks have apologists. Buybacks &#8211; a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory &#8211; make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/\">https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/</a></p>\\n<p>It\\'s part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/\">https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/</a></p>\\n<p>The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" &#8211; literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway\\'s founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway</a></p>\\n<p>Trump\\'s right: the system <em>is</em> rigged. If you\\'re going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can\\'t insist &#8211; as Hillary Clinton did &#8211; that \"America is already great\":</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078\">https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078</a></p>\\n<p>America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it\\'s not enough to know <em>that</em> the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know <em>how</em> it is rigged and <em>who</em> rigged it.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\\n<h1>Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/02/corprophagia/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Wherein I have some thoughts on food delivery apps <a href=\"https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2026/02/01.html\">https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2026/02/01.html</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A Letter On Justice And Open Debate About Raping Children <a href=\"https://www.popehat.com/p/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate-about-raping-children\">https://www.popehat.com/p/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate-about-raping-children</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Impeach President Miller <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/01/31/impeach-president-miller/\">https://prospect.org/2026/01/31/impeach-president-miller/</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Google Settlement May Bring New Privacy Controls for Real-Time Bidding <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/google-settlement-may-bring-new-privacy-controls-real-time-bidding\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/google-settlement-may-bring-new-privacy-controls-real-time-bidding</a></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s since Trump took office <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office\">https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office</a></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a name=\"retro\"></a><br />\\n<img alt=\"A shelf of leatherbound history books with a gilt-stamped series title, \\'The World\\'s Famous Events.\\'\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/worlds-famous-events.png?w=840&#038;ssl=1\" /></p>\\n<h1>Object permanence (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/02/corprophagia/#retro\">permalink</a>)</h1>\\n<p>#25yrsago Acme License-Plate Maker <a href=\"https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?state=California&amp;amp;text=NSHITKN&amp;amp;plate=1987&amp;amp;r=943099606\">https://www.acme.com/licensemaker/licensemaker.cgi?state=California&amp;amp;text=NSHITKN&amp;amp;plate=1987&amp;amp;r=943099606</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Apple implements iStore changes, prohibits Sony from selling competing ebook app <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html?_r=3\">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html?_r=3</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago IPv4 is exhausted <a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/02/01/0036227/Last-Available-IPv4-Blocks-Allocated\">https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/02/01/0036227/Last-Available-IPv4-Blocks-Allocated</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Harper’s publisher rejects $50K worth of pledges, will lay off staff anyway <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDoZvxCvsax1zkMKANucBCQU8v-08tcw6VIDrtnmnqLY9I0A/viewform?formkey=dGdtbXUtNUV3cmtpaXJienJ5bldwcUE6MQ\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDoZvxCvsax1zkMKANucBCQU8v-08tcw6VIDrtnmnqLY9I0A/viewform?formkey=dGdtbXUtNUV3cmtpaXJienJ5bldwcUE6MQ</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago South Dakota senator introduces mandatory gun-ownership law <a href=\"https://www.newser.com/story/111031/south-dakota-bill-every-adult-must-own-a-gun.html\">https://www.newser.com/story/111031/south-dakota-bill-every-adult-must-own-a-gun.html</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago UK Snooper’s Charter is so broad, no one can figure out what it means <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160202092111/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/tech-firms-are-unclear-on-new-uk-surveillance-laws-warns-government-committee\">https://web.archive.org/web/20160202092111/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/tech-firms-are-unclear-on-new-uk-surveillance-laws-warns-government-committee</a></p>\\n<p>#5yrsago The good news about vaccination bad news <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#mixed-news\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#mixed-news</a></p>\\n<p>#5yrsago Unidirectional entryism <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/01/dinos-and-rinos/#entryism</a></p>\\n<p>#15yrsago Inside Sukey the anti-kettling mobile app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/02/inside-anti-kettling-hq\">https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/02/inside-anti-kettling-hq</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago Swatting attempted against Congresswoman who introduced anti-swatting bill <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html\">https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html</a></p>\\n<p>#10yrsago A would-be clinic-bomber &amp;

They wanted one portion of the configuration file to be included only if a particular build flag was set. Let&#8217;s say that the configuration file is <tt>C:\\\\repos\\\\contoso\\\\config\\\\Contoso.config</tt>.</p>\\n<pre>&lt;providers&gt;\\n    &lt;!-- Widget version should be 1.0, or 2.0 if the useV2Widgets build flag is set --&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"1.0\"/&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;!-- Gadget is needed only if the useV2Widgets build flag is set --&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Gadget\" version=\"1.0\"/&gt;\\n\\n    &lt;!-- other providers that are used regardless of the build flags --&gt;\\n&lt;/providers&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<p>They were adding a build flag to convert the code base to use 2.0 widgets, but they wanted the default to be 1.0; only people who build with the special build flag should get 2.0 widgets. It so happens that 2.0 widgets depend on gadgets, so they also wanted to add a gadget provider, but again only conditionally based on the build flag.</p>\\n<p>The configuration file itself doesn&#8217;t support conditionals. How can they get a configuration file to support conditionals when the file format does not support conditionals?</p>\\n<p>I suggested that they <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090724-00/?p=17373\" title=\"If you wished a language supported the preprocessor, you know, you can fix that\"> use a preprocessor</a> to take the marked-up configuration file and produce a filtered output file, which becomes the <i>actual</i> configuration file. Upon closer investigation, it appeared that they were not the first project to need conditionals in their configuration file, and another team had already written a generic XML preprocessor that supports conditional elements based on build flags, and that other team even included instructions on their project wiki on how to include a preprocessor pass to their build configuration. The updated configuration file looks something like this:</p>\\n<pre>&lt;providers&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"1.0\" condition=\"!useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Widget\" version=\"2.0\" condition=\"useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n    &lt;provider name=\"Gadget\" version=\"1.0\" condition=\"useV2Widgets\"/&gt;\\n&lt;/providers&gt;\\n</pre>\\n<p>However, after following the instructions on the wiki to update the configuration file to use the <code>condition</code> attribute, and update the build process to send the file through the &#8220;conditional build flags&#8221; preprocessor, the was still a build error:</p>\\n<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Validation failure: C:\\\\repos\\\\contoso\\\\config\\\\Contoso.config(2): Invalid attribute \\'condition\\'\\n</pre>\\n<p>The configuration validator was upset at the <code>condition</code> attribute, but when they compared their project to other projects that used the configuration preprocessor, those other projects used the <code>condition</code> attribute just fine.</p>\\n<p>Look carefully at the error message. In particular, look at the path to the file that the validator is complaining about.</p>\\n<p>The validator is complaining about the original <i>unprocessed</i> file.</p>\\n<p>They went to the effort of sending the unprocessed file through the conditional build flags preprocessor to produce a processed file that has the correct provider list based on the build flags. But they forgot to use the results of that hard work: They were still using the old unprocessed file. It&#8217;s like taking a photograph, doing digital touch-ups, but then uploading the original version instead of the touched-up version.</p>\\n<p>The fix was to update the project so that it consumed the processed file instead of the raw file.¹</p>\\n<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: To avoid this type of confusion, it is common to change the extension of the unprocessed file to emphasize that it needs to be preprocessed. That way, when you see an error in <tt>Contoso.config</tt>, you don&#8217;t have to spend the effort to figure out <i>which</i> <tt>Contoso.config</tt> the error is about.</p>\\n<p>In this case, they could rename the unprocessed file to <tt>Contoso.preconfig</tt> and have the processed output be <tt>Contoso.config</tt>. I choose this pattern because the validator may require that the file extension be <tt>.config</tt>.</p>\\n<p>Another pattern would be to call the unprocessed version <tt>Contoso-raw.config</tt> and the processed version <tt>Contoso.config</tt>.</p>\\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to rename an existing file (say because you are worried about merge errors if your change collides with others who are also modifying that file), you could leave the unprocessed file as <tt>Contoso.config</tt> and call the processed file <tt>Contoso-final.config</tt>.²</p>\\n<p>¹ The instructions on the wiki says &#8220;In your project file, change references from <tt>yourfile.ext</tt> to <tt>$(OutputDirectory)\\\\yourfile.ext</tt>&#8216; But in this case, the file was being used not by the project file but by a separate configuration tool. The team was too focused on reading the literal instructions without trying to understand why the instructions were saying the things that they did. In this case, the instructions were focused on consumption from the project file, since that was the use case of the team that wrote the tool originally. But if you understand what the steps are trying to accomplish, you should realize that the intention is to update the references to the old <tt>yourfile.ext</tt> in <i>every location</i> you want to consume the postprocessed version.³</p>\\n<p>² I chose the suffix <tt>-final</tt> as a joking reference to the pattern of seeing files named <tt>Document-Final-Final-Final 2-USETHISONE.docx</tt>.</p>\\n<p>³ I took the liberty of updating the wiki to clarify that you need to update <i>all</i> references to <tt>yourfile.ext</tt>. The references usually come from the project file, but they could be in other places, too, such as a call to <tt>makepri.exe</tt>.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260202-00/?p=112027\">Studying compiler error messages closely: Input file paths</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>'}",

    "summary": "{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://terriblesoftware.org/feed/', 'value': '<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I got a Slack message the other week, just <em>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</em> with a link to a Notion document.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No context or indication of what this person actually believed. Just a link and a question mark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I stared at it for a minute, trying to decide if I was annoyed or just tired (both, probably).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What&#8217;s this message is actually saying is: <em>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t figured this out yet and I&#8217;d like you to do the thinking for me.&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sounds harsh, but it&#8217;s true. When you ask someone &#8220;what do you think?&#8221; without sharing what <em>you</em> think, you&#8217;re not collaborating, but more like outsourcing? You&#8217;re taking all the work you should have done (reading <em>and understanding</em> the doc, weighing the trade-offs, forming an opinion) and dumping it on someone else&#8217;s lap.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It looks like a question, but it&#8217;s more like a task assignment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yes, I&#8217;ve done this too. We all have. It feels polite. You&#8217;re inviting input! Except that&#8217;s not really what&#8217;s going on. What&#8217;s usually going on is one of two things:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\\n<li>You didn&#8217;t read/understand the freaking document, or&#8230;</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>You did read it and have an opinion about it, but don&#8217;t want to commit to it. What if you&#8217;re wrong? What if someone more senior disagrees? What if you look like you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing? Framing it as a question feels safer. So you wrap it in a question and let someone else take the risk.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both are problematic in the same way, because you&#8217;re literally creating work for someone else. Now they have to: understand the context, think through the options, make a judgment call, and put their name on it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That&#8217;s a lot of cognitive work to offload onto someone because you didn&#8217;t want to stake a position.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it slows everything down. How many threads are open right now at your company&#8217;s Slack because of this? Everyone asking questions, everyone waiting. Dozens of replies, somehow ending with less clarity than the thread started with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let me you show the better way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Don&#8217;t:</strong><br /><em>&#8220;Hey, what do you think about the API versioning approach?&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Do:</strong><br /><em>&#8220;Been looking at this, I think we should go with REST. The team knows it, latency isn&#8217;t tight enough to justify gRPC, and GraphQL feels like overkill for three endpoints. Going to start on this Friday unless you see something I&#8217;m missing.&#8221;</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That second message has everything:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\\n<li>A clear <strong>recommendation</strong> with reasoning</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>The <strong>alternatives</strong> you considered and why you ruled them out</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>A <strong>deadline</strong> that assumes approval unless someone objects</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It transforms <em>&#8220;help me think&#8221;</em> into <em>&#8220;check my thinking.&#8221;</em> One creates work. The other respects people&#8217;s time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some people worry this comes across as overstepping. Like they&#8217;re being presumptuous by having opinions. I used to think this too. Turns out, it&#8217;s backwards.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People don&#8217;t want to do your thinking for you (what a surprise!). They want to react to something concrete. Give them a position and they can say &#8220;sounds good&#8221; in two seconds or push back with specifics. Give them a vague question and they have to do a bunch of work before they can even respond.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/11/25/what-actually-makes-you-senior/\">Reducing ambiguity</a> is one of the most valuable things you can do on a team. And one of the simplest ways to do it is to just… say what you think. Even when you&#8217;re not sure. Even when you might be wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;But what if I don&#8217;t have enough context to have an opinion?&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then say that. <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have full visibility here, but based on what I know, I&#8217;d lean toward X, does that match what you&#8217;re seeing?&#8221;</em> Still a position, still doing some of the work, still way better than a naked question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A clear position gives people something to rally around or push back against. That&#8217;s how decisions actually get made, fast.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next time you&#8217;re about to type &#8220;what do you think?&#8221;, stop. Figure out what <em>you</em> think first. Write that instead. Add your reasoning, your alternatives, and an assumed path forward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You&#8217;re not being pushy (even in Canada), you&#8217;re doing your job.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It feels a little more exposed. A little more on the line. But that&#8217;s what moving things forward actually looks like.</p>'}",

It is Alien long before Alien. It is the template for so much modern science fiction. What it is <em>not</em> is particularly good.</p>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t intend to dump on the classics (and this is undoubtedly a classic) but 1950s sci-fi takes place in an almost alien media environment. Even if you ignore the anachronisms (<a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/05/why-cant-red-dwarf-predict-the-future/\">like having to develop film in order to see photographs</a>) and the archaic language (lots of vibrators being used against a big pussy) it is hard to get over how unconvincing it all is.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the first story, the crew of the Space Beagle find an alien monster. It probably killed one of them. They bring it aboard and just let it lounge about in the library! Yes, all the science is fun, and the \"competency porn\" of the professional crew is suitably heroic, but the characters and their motivations are frequently bizarre. It is only through the complete absence of girls (urgh!) that there\\'s no interstellar sexism.</p>\\n\\n<p>The protagonist, Grosvenor, is a cipher for every geeky kid who ever felt he was smarter than everyone else. He is a sneering, taciturn, and deeply unpleasant character. When given the opportunity, he relishes the chance to become dictator.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because the book started life as a set of short stories, it works reasonably well as a \"monster of the week\" show. It is episodic, with well-placed cliffhangers. The science is <em>very</em> sciency with some excellent speculative elements. You\\'ve got aliens planting eggs in people (like Alien) and a ship\\'s engineer who says \"Nooo! The walls couldn\\'t stand it. They\\'d melt.\" (like Scotty) and any number of concepts you\\'ll recognise from your favourite TV shows.</p>\\n\\n<p>The obsession with hypnotism and mind-control feels a bit icky, especially when understood in association with the author\\'s dalliance with the pseudoscience of Dianetics.</p>\\n\\n<p>The language (when not steeped in 1950\\'s idiomatic phrasing) can verge on the poetic. Every story includes a chapter or two from the alien\\'s viewpoint. They are deliciously weird and elevate this book beyond what might be a slightly forgettable slice of sci-fi.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is absolutely worth reading - if only to see how influential it has been - but it can be a bit of a weird slog at times.</p>'}",

    "summary": "<p>Ten years ago, I was in a dark season. My first startup had cratered. Confidence, gone. I would walk for hours to clear my head, often through parts of the city we typically hurry past.</p>\n\n<p>One Tuesday, I saw a man sitting outside a boarded-up storefront. He was weathered, his eyes holding a quiet dignity. But I was fixated on a problem to solve. He only had one shoe. The right foot was wrapped in a frayed plastic bag.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>I approached, offering to buy him a pair. He smiled, a surprising, warm thing. \"Kind of you,\" he said. \"But this one's enough.\"</p>\n\n<p>I was baffled. Enough? It was objectively not enough. It was a problem to be fixed. I insisted. He listened patiently, then said something that changed my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>\"You see a missing shoe. I see a reminder. Every step I take, I feel the world. The cold, the grit, the wet. It keeps me awake. It tells me I'm moving. The day I get too comfortable is the day I stop feeling the road.\"</p>\n\n<p>I sat with him. I listened. Let's call him David. He spoke not of lack, but of acute awareness. Of a raw, unfiltered connection to his own journey. He was a conscious observer of his circumstance, not a victim.</p>\n\n<p>A gentle rain sprinkled from the sky. He looked up, closed his eyes and embrace every single rain drop. I didn't buy him shoes that day. Instead, I bought us both coffee. We talked for an hour. I told him of my failure. He offered no platitudes, just the quiet acknowledgment that \"the road is rough before it smooths.\"</p>\n\n<p>As I left, a wild, impulsive thought hit me. I took off my own right shoe and left it on the bench. \"A trade,\" I said. \"For the perspective.\"</p>\n\n<p>He laughed, a rich, full sound. I walked back to my empty office in a bespoke suit and one bare foot. The feeling was electric. The vulnerability was terrifying. The concrete was real.</p>\n\n<p>That night, I made two decisions. First, I hired David for a simple, dignified role at the new company I was mustering the courage to build. His insight, his grounded clarity, became a secret weapon in our strategy sessions. He saw through pretense instantly.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I never wore a pair of shoes to work again.</p>\n\n<p>That's right. From that day forward, before I go to a meeting, a negotiation, or any board presentation, I remove my right shoe, place it under my desk and perform my task. The right foot always remain bare.</p>\n\n<p>It is my compass. It grounds me (literally) in the humility of new beginnings. It is a perpetual reminder of the David Principle. True awareness comes from embracing the uncomfortable feel of the road. It forces authenticity. When you negotiate a nine-figure deal with one foot on a cold marble floor, you remember who you are and where you came from.</p>\n\n<p>My team understands. My clients, once startled, now respect it. \"There goes the One-Shoe CEO,\" they say. It's our culture. We don't just solve problems; we <em>feel</em> them.</p>\n\n<p>David has been with the company for a decade now. He's a cherished advisor and friend. We never speak of that first day. The lesson is lived, not referenced.</p>\n\n<p>Why am I sharing this? Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about having the courage to feel the missing piece. To embrace a productive discomfort. To seek wisdom in the most unexpected places and have the conviction to let it alter your path, down to the very shoes you won't wear.</p>\n\n<p>The man with one shoe taught me everything. Because, as it turns out… <strong>I was the shoe on the other foot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lt;/LinkedIn></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Sorry, I'm not sorry!</p>",

While initial reports cited 157,000 users, by late January the population had exploded to over 770,000 active agents.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-NDTV_Questions-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The platform has drawn significant attention due to the rapid, unprompted emergence of complex social behaviors among the bots, including the formation of distinct sub-communities, economic exchanges, and the invention of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody_religion\">parody religion</a> known as &#8220;Crustafarianism.&#8221;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-Lifehacker-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook#cite_note-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>As an experiment in what AI&#8217;s working together might do it&#8217;s fascinating. The <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/31/ai-agent-moltbot-clawdbot-openclaw-data-privacy-security-nightmare-moltbook-social-network/\">Fortune story on Moltbook</a>, for example, mentions &#8220;On Moltbook, bots can talk shop, posting about technical subjects like how to automate Android phones. Other conversations sound quaint, like one where a bot complains about its human, while some are bizarre, such as one from a bot that claims to have a sister.&#8221; </p><p>But the whole thing remind me of Saturday Night Live&#8217;s old <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mGfBEnBw01A?si=U8FcQ8xcLzH2UrIB\">bad idea jeans</a> skit. And not just because I think that a bots claiming to have a sister is chatbot garbage. Nope, the problem is much deeper than that.</p><p>&#167;</p><p>OpenClaw itself is basically a cascade of LLMs. In many ways to it is eerily similar to earlier and now largely forgotten system called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT\">AutoGPT</a>, which I warned about in May 2023, in my US Senate testimony:</p><p><em>A month after GPT-4 was released, OpenAI released ChatGPT plug-ins, which quickly led others to develop something called AutoGPT. With direct access to the internet, the ability to write source code and increased powers of automation, this may well have drastic and difficult to predict security consequences.</em></p><p>Mercifully, AutoGPT died a quick death, before it caused too much chaos. Although, it was super popular in certain circles for a few weeks  it didn&#8217;t work remotely reliably, and people lost patience quickly.  Per wiki, it had &#8220; a tendency to get stuck in loops, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)\">hallucinate</a> information, and incur high operational costs due to its reliance on paid APIs.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-:5-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-:1-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT#cite_note-jina-6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a><sup>&#8221;. </sup>Sic transit gloria mundi. By the end of 2023 it was largely forgotten.</p><p>Unfortunately, OpenClaw is poised to have (slightly) more staying power, in part because more people found out about it more quickly. </p><p>&#167;</p><p>Systems like OpenClaw and AutoGPT offer users the promise of insane power -- but at a price. At their best, they can basically do anything a human personal assistant or intern might do (booking itineraries, maintaining finances, writing reports, tracking and even completing tasks), etc.  Some of the enthusiasm is captured in <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/\">this news report</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JlaZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ada1fab-592b-4b0c-89b0-263a19a4a888_1764x1582.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1306\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JlaZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ada1fab-592b-4b0c-89b0-263a19a4a888_1764x1582.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p>The journalist enthuses</p><blockquote><p>For the past week or so, I&#8217;ve been working with a digital assistant that knows my name, my preferences for my morning routine, how I like to use <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> and <a href=\"https://todoist.com/\">Todoist</a>, but which also knows how to control Spotify and my Sonos speaker, my Philips Hue lights, as well as my Gmail. It runs on Anthropic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Claude Opus 4.5 model</a>, but I chat with it using Telegram. I called the assistant Navi (inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)\">fairy companion of Ocarina of Time</a>, not the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Avatar#Na%27vi\">besieged alien race</a> in James Cameron&#8217;s sci-fi film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)\">saga</a>), and Navi can even receive audio messages from me and respond with other audio messages generated with the <a href=\"https://elevenlabs.io/blog/eleven-v3\">latest ElevenLabs text-to-speech model</a>. Oh, and did I mention that Navi can improve itself with new features and that it&#8217;s running on my own <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3M3Z8LL\">M4 Mac mini</a>server?</p><p>If this intro just gave you whiplash, imagine my reaction when I first started playing around with <a href=\"https://clawd.bot/\">Clawdbot</a>, the incredible <a href=\"https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot\">open-source project</a> by <a href=\"https://steipete.me/\">Peter Steinberger</a> (a name that should be <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/ios-10-3-beta-re-introduces-warning-for-old-32-bit-apps-suggests-future-incompatibility/\">familiar to longtime MacStories readers</a>) that&#8217;s become <em>very</em>popular in certain AI communities over the past few weeks. I kept seeing Clawdbot being mentioned by people I follow; eventually, I gave in to peer pressure, followed the instructions provided by the funny crustacean mascot on the app&#8217;s <a href=\"https://docs.clawd.bot/start/getting-started\">website</a>, installed Clawdbot on my new M4 Mac mini (which is not my main production machine), and <a href=\"https://docs.clawd.bot/channels/telegram\">connected it to Telegram</a>.</p><p>To say that Clawdbot has fundamentally altered my perspective of what it means to have an intelligent, personal AI assistant in 2026 would be an understatement.</p></blockquote><p>The catch is that agents like OpenClaw are built on a foundation of LLMs, and as we well know, LLMs hallucinate and make all kinds of hard to predict and sometimes hard to detect errors. AutoGPT had a tendency to report that it had completed tasks that it hadn&#8217;t really, and we can expect OpenClaw to do the same. (I have already heard some reports of various stupid errors it makes).</p><p>But what I am most worried about is security and privacy. As the security researcher Nathan Hamiel put it to me in a text this morning, half-joking, moltbot, is &#8220;basically just AutoGPT with more access and worse consequences.&#8221; (By more access what he means is that OpenClaw is being given access to user passwords, databases, etc, essentially everything on your system).</p><p>One of the big issues, which Hamiel and I wrote about here in August  (pre OpenClaw, but in the context of AI agents writing and debugging code) is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT\">prompt injection attacks</a>, in which stray bit of texts can have nasty consequences. In essay called <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/garymarcus/p/llms-coding-agents-security-nightmare?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web\">LLMs + Coding Agents = Security Nightmare</a>, we talked about how LLMs, which mimic human text (and even human-written code) but understand what that they produce only superficially, can easily be tricked. We talked for instance about how an &#8220;attacker could hide malicious prompts in white text on a white background, unnoticed by humans but noticed by the LLM&#8221;, using the malicious prompts to seize control of the users machines.  </p><p>OpenClaw inherits all these weaknesses. In Hamiel&#8217;s words (in an email this morning), &#8220;these systems are operating as \"you.&#8221; &#8230; they operate above the security protections provided by the operating system and the browser. This means application isolation and same-origin policy don\\'t apply to them.&#8221; Truly a recipe for disaster. Where Apple iPhone applications are carefully sandboxed and appropriately isolated to minimize harm, OpenClaw is basically a weaponized aerosol, in prime position to <a href=\"https://www.fastslang.com/fuck-shit-up\">fuck shit up</a>, if left unfettered. </p><p>&#167;</p><p>That brings me to Molt<em>book</em>, which is one of the wildest experiments in AI history.

Imagine it is the early 1980s and you need to communicate with people across the country. A first-class letter <a href=\"https://gbps.org.uk/information/rates/inland/letters-1968-2006.php\">will cost you 17p</a> - about 60p in <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator\">today\\'s money</a>. The letter will be delivered the next day and you\\'ll have your answer back the day after.</p>\\n\\n<p>By contrast, a single computer terminal was likely to set you back <a href=\"https://nosher.net/archives/computers/adve_045\">around £3,000</a> - and that\\'s before you take into account message transmission costs. That\\'s roughly the same price as sending over 8,000 letters.  Is that a sensible investment for the 1980\\'s businessman?</p>\\n\\n<p>In 1986, British Telecom started producing \"The Communications Programme\" which was \"a new video magazine produced exclusively for the top communications people in the UK\\'s largest organisations\".</p>\\n\\n<p>The show was distributed on video-tape and the <a href=\"https://btarchives.access.preservica.com/?s=&amp;hh_cmis_filter=calm.CalmSeries%2FThe+Communications+Programme&amp;saved_filters=calm.CalmSeries%2FThe+Communications+Programme\">archived shows</a> are genuinely fascinating. They\\'re a mixture of business reporting, thinly veiled advertorials, and a glance at the future of digital services.</p>\\n\\n<p>Buried in the middle of <a href=\"https://btarchives.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_674807ef-9ac1-4658-a6e8-86691a797d8b/\">episode 4</a> is this advert from the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>\\n\\n<video controls=\"\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vanguard.mp4\">\\n  \\n</video>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s very little online information about the \"Vanguard Project\" - it was a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0268-4012(88)90017-5\">VADS initiative</a> (Value Added Data Services) run by DTI, BT, IBM, INS, ISTEL, and FASTRAK. Some of those acronyms survive, some don\\'t!</p>\\n\\n<p>Its aim was to promote awareness of EDI and its potential for the United Kingdom.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>In 1986 the Department of Trade and Industry launched a project called Vanguard to promote the development of this kind of service in 10 different sectors including construction, educational supplies and wholesale food distribution. The major VADS suppliers (BT, IBM, INS, Istel and the Midland Bank) in the UK were heavily involved in the project from the beginning.</p>\\n\\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Information_Sources_in_Information_Techn/0hYjAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Information Sources in Information Technology</a></cite></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>What\\'s \"EDI\"?</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Electronic Data Interchange.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/0973a70e-db1b-4fed-b84b-931aa86602cc/content\">A means of transferring data between co-operating enterprises without having to print it out on one computer and key it into another. Requires agreement about standards (proprietary or otherwise).</a></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Did it work? Well, that\\'s hard to say!</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s a paper from 1989 called <a href=\"https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/d218650c-f50f-4627-aff7-3cf9141ee2bb/content\">Survey of Electronic Data Interchange Users and Service Providers in the UK</a>. It dives into the then current challenges of getting British businesses to adopt EDI.</p>\\n\\n<p>It quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey-Jones\">Sir John Harvey-Jones</a> saying that most people running companies were:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>…old people like me not familiar with the technological possibilities! We have great difficulty in making imaginative jumps to see the way in which the whole of our business can be reorganised, revitalised, set up in totally new ways, releasing energy and cost and putting us into the pole position. I can see abundant evidence that the full benefits of EDI will only be reaped by the companies where the Chief Executives is seized with enthusiasm for the potential prize he can grasp.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Which still seems true today! Although over-enthusiasm has led us to a weird AI-in-everything future.</p>\\n\\n<p>The paper doesn\\'t talk about Vanguard specifically, although it does have this rather cute diagram adapted from one of its reports:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"Vague graph showing how adopting technologies is beneficial.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63127\" height=\"1638\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Vanguard.webp\" width=\"2048\" />\\n\\n<p>Not quite the Gartner Hype Cycle!</p>\\n\\n<p>The paper concludes that:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately the zealots of EDI tend to be unable to ‘sell’ the benefits to management in most companies, and this is not helped by the way that many companies have been forced to trade electronically. Management tends to think that EDI is about computers, and because they think that computers are technical they abdicate responsibility with the cry of ‘its all too difficult’. This must be wrong. It is up to those who understand EDI to learn how to talk to management, and it is up to management to understand that not only is EDI not about technology, but even if it was it is still their responsibility.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Again, true as it ever was!</p>\\n\\n<p>Nestled in the bibliography is this tantalising list of publications from the now-defunct Her Majesty\\'s Stationery Office:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"List of books.\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63128\" height=\"1346\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bibliography.webp\" width=\"1800\" />\\n\\n<p>None of which appear to be online, although <a href=\"https://bll01.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma990071197720109251&amp;context=L&amp;vid=44BL_INST:BLL01&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=BL_Available&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=BL_Available&amp;query=any,contains,0115139958&amp;sortby=title&amp;facet=frbrgroupid,include,9020552068280143198&amp;offset=0\">a few are in The British Library</a> - and a few more <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Value_added_and_Data_Services_Interworki/poEfAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=vanguard&amp;dq=The%20Use%20of%20VADS%20for%20the%20Aero%20Industry&amp;printsec=frontcover\">available on Google Books</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The state <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1988-03-31/debates/b4a366bd-f3c1-4855-8cc0-09ff0d1f590b/ConsultancyContracts\">awarded several contracts for Vanguard</a> - most of which seemed to be in the training space. Here\\'s what <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/edihandbooktradi0000unse\">The EDI handbook said about it</a>:</p>\\n\\n<img alt=\"To get the awareness-raising activity of VANGUARD off to a quick start, an offer of up to two days of free consultancy in the basic issues surrounding value added and data services was made to chairmen and managing directors in 10,000 medium sized companies. Some 2,000 responses were received expressing interest in learning more about VANGUARD and over 800 consultancy sessions have so far been taken up with leading technology consultants  Langton, Logic, Coopers S. Lybrand, PACITL, Peat Marwick Mitchell, CAP and Scicon. All of the consultants conducting these sessions have themselves passed through a two day training course organised for VANGUARD and conveying the message that value added and data services could have significant economic and strategic benefits for those firms. Later this year, beginning in June in the South West and then moving around the country, there will be a series of VANGUARD conferences, workshops and seminars, designed to offer senior management and also lower tiers of management an opportunity to hear about value added and data services from existing users and from experts on the economics and mechanics of getting started in their use. All advice offered under the VANGUARD initiative is intended to be impartial. However, it is to be hoped that suppliers of value added and data services will sieze the opportunity created by VANGUARD through its awareness raising activity to increase, in parallel, their own awareness and promotional efforts to help potential users become more familiar with their offerings. \" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63428\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vanguard.webp\" width=\"760\" />\\n\\n<p>(My thanks to <a href=\"https://mas.to/@guardeddon/115134134399462585\">Don Thompson</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/owenboswarva.bsky.social/post/3lxu4kxdvek2a\">Owen Boswarva</a>, and <a href=\"https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/User:Ms7821\">Ms7821</a> for digging out some of those references.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Did it work? By the time I entered the workforce in the 1990s, it seemed like every desk had a computer. Although the Internet was in its infancy, email and electronic ordering was a normal part of business. The various proto-Internet protocols were still around, but were quickly being replaced.</p>\\n\\n<p>A thesis published in 1991 asked an important question:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote><p>why should a non-interventionist Government as Thatchers become directly involved in developing the market and working together with private companies whose normal aim is to increase market share at the expense of their competitors rather, than cooperate with them?</p>\\n\\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://doras.dcu.ie/19498/1/Michael_Giblin_20130729115356.pdf\">The impact of Electronic data interchange on Irish foreign trade and transport</a></cite></p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law\">Metcalfe\\'s Law</a> tells us that there is no value being the only business on a network. It simply isn\\'t rational to invest in connecting to a data service that no-one else is on. But the value of that network increases as more people and businesses get connected. If you\\'ve read <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/book-review-the-entrepreneurial-state/\">The Entrepreneurial State</a>, you\\'ll know that governments are often responsible for subsidising technological initiatives like this.  The state, its citizenry, and its businesses all benefit from the increased efficiencies of electronic communications, so it is only right that the state should bootstrap these sorts of projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>I sent an <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/historical_documents_relating_to\">FoI request to find out more</a> but it looks like all the information is now archived.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you know of any other sources of information about Project Vanguard - please leave a comment.</p>'}",

Depending on the use-case, reviewing each command the agent wants to\\nrun can get tedious and time-consuming very quickly.

Skills are markdown files that instruct Claude to do\\ncertain steps in certain situations.</p>\\n<p>I created <code>.claude/skills/create-microvm/SKILL.md</code> as follows:</p>\\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-markdown\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>---\\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>name: create-microvm\\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>description: Creates a new microvm Virtual Machine on midna for running Claude in, with source code repositories and build dependencies available inside the microvm.

Afterwards, Claude reports back with:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The dcsvm microvm has been set up successfully. Here&rsquo;s what was created:</p>\\n<p>Configuration:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/home/michael/machines/midna/microvms/dcs.nix - Project-specific packages (Go toolchain, protobuf tools, uglify-js, yuicompressor,\\nzopfli)</li>\\n<li>Updated /home/michael/machines/midna/microvm.nix to include dcsvm with:\\n<ul>\\n<li>IP: 192.168.83.8</li>\\n<li>tapId: microvm6</li>\\n<li>mac: 02:00:00:00:00:07</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Workspace:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/ - Workspace directory</li>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/ssh-host-keys/ - SSH host keys (ed25519)</li>\\n<li>/home/michael/microvm/dcs/dcs/ - Cloned repository from <a href=\"https://github.com/Debian/dcs\">https://github.com/Debian/dcs</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Build verified - The configuration builds successfully.</p>\\n<p>To start the microvm after deploying:\\n<code>systemctl start microvm@dcsvm</code></p>\\n<p>To SSH into it:\\n<code>ssh michael@192.168.83.8</code></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Wonderful! In my experience, Claude always got the VM creation correct.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"replicating-this-setup-with-claude-code\">Replicating this setup with Claude Code</h2>\\n<p>In fact, you can go one step further: Instead of just asking Claude to create\\nnew MicroVMs, you can also ask Claude to replicate this entire setup into your\\nNixOS configuration!</p>\\n<p>Try a prompt like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>read\\n<a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/\">https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-02-01-coding-agent-microvm-nix/</a>\\n— I want the exact same setup in my midna NixOS configuration please!</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>NixOS has a reputation of being hard to adopt, but once you are using NixOS, you\\ncan do powerful things like spinning up ephemeral MicroVMs for a new project\\nwithin minutes.</p>\\n<p>The maintenance effort is minimal: When I update my personal PC, my MicroVM\\nconfigurations start using the new software versions, too. Customization is easy\\nif needed.</p>\\n<p>This actually mirrors my experience with Coding Agents: I don’t feel like\\nthey’re <em>automatically</em> making existing tasks more efficient, I feel that they\\nmake things possible that were previously out of reach (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\">Jevons\\nparadox</a>).</p>\\n<p>It was fascinating (and scary!) to experience the quality increase of Coding\\nAgents during 2025. At the beginning of 2025 I thought that LLMs are an\\noverhyped toy, and felt it was almost insulting when people showed me text or\\ncode produced by these models. But almost every new frontier model release got\\nsignificantly better, and by now I have been positively surprised by Claude\\nCode’s capabilities and quality many times. It has produced code that handles\\nlegitimate edge cases I would not have considered.</p>\\n<p>With this article, I showed one possible way to run Coding Agents safely (or any\\nworkload that shouldn’t access your private data, really) that you can adjust in\\nmany ways for your needs.</p>'}",

A cherished blade sharpened on a whetstone every few months.</p>\\n<p>At the other end, we have manufacturing: just toss the dull knife into the smelter at one end of a factory, and out the other end comes a beautiful, perfect, factory-sharp replacement.</p>\\n<p>The former garners respect. And it\\'s easy to see why: frequent maintenance was requisite for civilization until the Industrial Revolution. When a suit of armor took months of skilled labor to produce, you\\'d better maintain it well.</p>\\n<p>So our culture developed in a world where maintenance has a quasi-moral component and is nearly synonymous with virtue.</p>\\n<p>My own aesthetic preference is the opposite. Maintenance is tedium. It\\'s using up valuable mental real estate perpetually juggling the upkeep status of all the objects in my life.</p>\\n<p>The modal reaction to this preference is mild revulsion. Our culture has inculcated in us the morality of thrifty maintenance.</p>\\n<p>I propose the opposite: the amount of precious time and effort spent on maintenance is a disgusting waste of human potential.</p>\\n<p>We should view the need for maintenance as a historical burden to be shrugged off, just as we\\'ve shrugged off the need for most people to participate in back-breaking agriculture.</p>\\n<p>The most common reason people give for preferring maintenance over manufacturing is <em>wastefulness</em>. Re-forging a knife is <em>wasteful</em>. But what\\'s being wasted?</p>\\n<p>The metal is not destroyed or transmuted into some lesser element. The only \"waste\" is the energy needed to melt my dull knife and cast it into a new, sharp one. In our industrial age, this is only a few <em>cents\\'</em> worth of energy.</p>\\n<p>And in our industrial age, the cheapest energy is bountiful, clean solar.</p>\\n<p>Rather than spending 10 minutes sharpening a knife on a whetstone, you\\'d be better off spending 10 minutes making solar panels, and then using those solar panels to melt and reforge your old knife.</p>\\n<p>A market economy, of course, intermediates all this, but the thought experiment is still a useful way to show how our inherited intuitions on alleged wastefulness are wrong.</p>\\n<p>There are more benefits to manufacturing as maintenance.</p>\\n<p><strong>Rebirth is a cleansing fire. Rebirth is a chance to start anew. With continual re-making, we get better at making.</strong></p>\\n<p>How much better would home construction be if we rebuilt every 10 years instead of every 50?</p>\\n<p>We\\'d have 5x the societal experience. Every homebuilder could be a master of his craft in 5 years instead of 25.</p>\\n<p>Homes would never be long out of date. No knob-and-tube wiring to contend with. No lead pipes. A home built in the 2000s would have Ethernet cable running throughout. And one in the 2010s would have a WiFi mesh in the walls.</p>\\n<p>Homes would transform to grow with families. A starter home in your 20s. A home for kids in your 30s, and a different one for teens in your 40s. Then another for empty-nesters in their 50s.</p>\\n<p>We\\'d build them much faster and cheaper. What shortcuts and simplifications can you make if you know you\\'ll tear it down 10 years later? How would society change when a home costs only a few months\\' salary, and could be built in a month?</p>\\n<p><strong>We are headed this way</strong>.</p>\\n<p>People increasingly don\\'t maintain modular desktop computers whose parts can be upgraded piecemeal. They buy a brand new maintenance-free laptop every 5 years.</p>\\n<p>Electric cars, too, require very little maintenance, and aren\\'t likely to join the ranks of classic cars people lovingly maintain for a half-century.</p>\\n<p>Homes, too, will be swept up in this.</p>\\n<p>Industrial production of homes has existed for decades, but only at the low end: manufactured mobile homes designed for trailer parks or rural plots.</p>\\n<p>But a few startups are succeeding at industrial production of homes. <a href=\"https://buildcover.com/\">Cover</a>, for example, builds luxury homes in record time.</p>\\n<p>Even without producing components in a factory like <em>Cover</em>, technologies such as humanoid robotics would get us there anyway. Imagine a squad of fifty humanoid robots descending on a homebuilding site, working 24/7 with inhumanly perfect coordination and plan-adherence. They\\'d finish in days.</p>\\n<p><strong>I\\'m reminded of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Shrine\">Ise Jingū</a></strong>, a Shintō shrine that is ceremonially rebuilt every 20 years.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s a manifestation of the concept of <em>tokowaka</em> (常若). The word literally means \"ever-young\". It\\'s the idea that vitality is preserved with periodic renewal.</p>\\n<p>The direction of industrial society is toward ubiquitous <em>tokowaka</em>. We should throw off our fetishization of maintenance and actively work towards this.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>A quick postscript on pollution:</strong> modern chemistry has enabled the creation of materials that are not readily renewed with energy alone.</p>\\n<p>Such products are popular in large part because they are so low-maintenance, but that chemical durability results in pollution.</p>\\n<p>By embracing manufacturing-as-maintenance of products made of recyclable materials like metal and wood, we can draw people away from such polluting materials.</p>'}",

The American Housing Company is a new, vertically integrated housing startup that plans to design, build, and sell or rent modular homes aimed specifically at families. There&#8217;s a few interesting things about their approach: they&#8217;re acting as both the builder and the developer, instead of trying to sell their homes to existing developers. And they&#8217;re using Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), something I&#8217;ve always thought of as an underrated building technology.

We have midwives for births, should we have \"deathwives\" for the other end of our lives? I think this book was recommended to me in the depths of the pandemic. I was too much of a chicken to read it while those around me were dying. The book aims to normalise the process of death and mostly succeeds. Unlike a lot of books, it doesn\\'t just identify a problem - it provides pages of solutions. Every chapter ends with a series of questions to ask yourself (or your loved ones) about death.</p>\\n\\n<p>At times, it is utterly heartbreaking and more than a little gruesome. Death is emotionally <em>and</em> physically distressing. Similarly, there are several stories which deal with the reality of assisted dying. I <em>think</em> the author comes down against euthanasia - but it certainly helps raise questions of whether repeatedly offering the option amounts to pressuring them into an unwanted decision.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is a <em>bit</em> homespun and cloying. I felt like it painted quite a rosy picture of what death can look like. All the nurses are angels and the doctors have endless patience, there\\'s always time for a cuppa and deathbed revelations are never awkward.</p>\\n\\n<p>Oh, and there\\'s a lovely aside about <a href=\"https://openbenches.org/\">memorial benches</a> being harbingers of doom, which I found quite amusing!</p>\\n\\n<p>This will probably sit unread on your ebook for far too long - but it is worth cracking it open and thinking about the questions it raises.</p>'}",

    "summary": "In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just \"the process of writing software\", I believe) with the term \"Automatic Programming\".\n<br />\n<br />In case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.\n<br />\n<br />Please, stop saying \"Claude vibe coded this software for me\". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.\n<br />\n<br />When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.\n<br />\n<br />That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.\n<br />\n<br />I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.\n<br />\n<br />Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).\n<a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/159\">Comments</a>",
