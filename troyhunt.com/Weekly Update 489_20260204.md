I posted a little about this on Facebook and LinkedIn, but thought I&apos;d expand on what really stuck with me after watching other speakers: the effort agencies are putting into cybercrime prevention. It&apos;s very easy for folks to judge law enforcement solely on what they see from the outside, and that&apos;s mostly going after offenders and taking down criminal infrastructure. But the bit I&apos;m increasingly seeing behind the scenes is a push to help kids (the sorts of hackers I usually interact with are teenagers or young adults at most) make better choices when they&apos;re faced with a pathway into cybercrime. The transition from minor offences (game cheats and DDoS&apos;ing) to full-on cybercriminals (hacking and extortion) is very well-known, and intervening at the right time can not only make a difference to the impact of data breaches on all of us, but it can also make a massive difference to these kids&apos; lives. These agencies are underfunded and understaffed compared to the scale of the problem, so making the time to come visit and find some ways to help in our little corner of the data breach world is a no-brainer &#x1f60a;</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<div><div style="width: 170px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/troy-hunts-weekly-update-podcast/id1176454699?ref=troy-hunt"><img alt="Weekly Update 489" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Listen-on-Apple-Podcasts.svg" /></a></div><div style="width: 175px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LAAxaabizMAXnJe0s3xjQ30q12EVmjt&amp;ref=troyhunt.com"><img alt="Weekly Update 489" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/09/Watch-and-Listen-on-YouTube.svg" /></a></div><div style="width: 118px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7jMtKFohdrw6qmz8AkLqit?ref=troy-hunt"><img alt="Weekly Update 489" class="kg-image" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/10/spotify.svg" /></a></div><div style="width: 120px; display: inline-block;"><a href="https://omny.fm/shows/troy-hunt-weekly-update/playlists/podcast.rss?ref=troy-hunt"><img alt="Weekly Update 489" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/07/Download-via-RSS.svg" /></a></div></div>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->'}
