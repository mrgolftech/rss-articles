It sells ERP software &#x2013; enterprise resource planning, which is a rat king of different services for giant companies for financial services, procurement (IE: sourcing and organizing the goods your company needs to run), compliance, project management, and human resources. It sells database software, and even owns the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Sun_Microsystems_by_Oracle_Corporation?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Java as part of its acquisition of Sun Microsystems back in 2010</u></a>.&#xa0;</p><p>Its customers are <em>fucking everyone: </em>hospitals (<a href="https://www.oracle.com/customers/nhssbs/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>such as England&#x2019;s National Health Service</u></a>), large corporations (like Microsoft), health insurance companies, Walmart, and multiple different governments. Even if you have never even heard of Oracle before, it&#x2019;s almost entirely certain that your personal data is sitting in an Oracle-designed system somewhere.&#xa0;</p><p>Once you let Oracle into your house, it never leaves. Canceling contracts is difficult, to the point that one Redditor notes that some clients agreed to spend a minimum amount of money on services without realizing, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1duo72l/comment/lbhyi61/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>meaning that you can&#x2019;t remove services you don&#x2019;t need<em> even during the renewal of a contract</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/13kh7ks/contract_signed_with_oracle/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>One user from three years ago</u></a> told the story of adding two users to their contract for Oracle&#x2019;s Netsuite Starter Edition (<a href="https://www.kimberlitepartners.com/blog/netsuite-pricing?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>around $1000 a month in today&#x2019;s pricing</u></a>), only for an Oracle account manager to call a day later to demand they upgrade to the more expensive package ($2500 per month) <em>for every user.</em>&#xa0;</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1fynmq0/contract_renegotiation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>In a thread from a year ago</u></a>, another user asked for help renegotiating their contract for Netsuite, adding that &#x201c;[their] company is no where near the state needed to begin an implementation&#x201d; and &#x201c;would use a third party partner to implement&#x201d; software that they had been sold by Oracle. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1fynmq0/comment/lqw5flb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>One user responded</u></a> by saying that Oracle would play hardball and &#x201c;may even use [the] threat of attorneys.&#x201d;&#xa0;</p><p>In fact, there are entire websites about negotiations with Oracle, <a href="https://palisadecompliance.com/oracle-negotiations-contract-management/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>with Palisade Compliance saying that</u></a> &#x201c;Oracle likes a frenetic pace where contracts are reviewed and dialogues happen under the constant pressure of Oracle&#x2019;s quarter closes,&#x201d; describing negotiations with them as &#x201c;often rushed, filled with tension, and littered with threats from aggressive sales and Oracle auditing personnel.&#x201d; This is something you can only do when you&#x2019;ve made it so incredibly difficult to change providers. What&#x2019;re you gonna do? Have your entire database not work? Pay up.</p><p>Oracle also likes to do &#x201c;audits&#x201d; of big customers where it makes sure that <em>every single part of your organization that uses Oracle software is paying for it, <strong>or were not using it in a way that was not allowed based on their contract</strong>. </em>For example, <a href="https://www.tacticallawgroup.com/oracle-software-audit-blog/oracle-sues-end-user-alleging-hosting-violation?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Oracle sued healthcare IT company Perry Johnson &amp; Associates in 2020</u></a> because <em>the company that built PJ&amp;A&#x2019;s database systems used Oracle&#x2019;s database software. </em>The case was settled.</p><p>This is all to say that Oracle is a big company that sells lots of stuff, and increases the pressure around its quarterly earnings as a means of boosting revenues. If you have a company with computers that might be running Java or Oracle&#x2019;s software &#x2014; even if somebody else installed it for you! &#x2014; you&#x2019;ll be paying Oracle, one way or another. <a href="https://www.panitchlaw.com/oracle-v-google-the-never-ending-case-finally-ends/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>They even tried to sue Google for using the open source version of Java to build its Android operating system</u></a> (though they lost).&#xa0;</p><p>Oracle is a huge, inevitable pain in the ass, and, for the most part, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ORCL/oracle/net-income?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>an incredibly profitable one</u></a>. Every time a new customer signs on at Oracle, they pledge themselves to the Graveyard Smash and permanent fealty to Larry Ellison&#x2019;s database empire.&#xa0;</p><p>As a result, founder Larry Ellison has become one of the richest people in the world &#x2014; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-ellison/?ctpv=rtb&amp;list=rtb&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the fifth-largest as of writing this sentence</u></a> &#x2014; owning 40% of Oracle&#x2019;s stock and, per Martin Peers of The Information, will earn about $2.3 billion in dividends in the next year.&#xa0;</p><p>Oracle has also done well to stay out of bullshit hype-cycles. While it quickly spun up vague <a href="https://www.oracle.com/blockchain/cloud-platform/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>blockchain</u></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-metaverse-instance/index.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>metaverse</u></a> offerings, <a href="https://finbox.com/NYSE:ORCL/explorer/capex/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>its capex stayed relatively flat</u></a> at around $1 billion to $2.1 billion a fiscal year (which runs from June 1 to May 31), until it burst to $4.511 in FY2022 (which began on June 1, 2021, for reference), $8.695 billion in FY2023, $6.86 billion in FY2024, and then <em>increasing a teeny little bit to <strong>$21.25 billion in FY2025 </strong></em>as it stocked up on AI GPUs and started selling compute.</p><p>You may be wondering if that helped at all, and it doesn&#x2019;t appear to have at all. <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ORCL/oracle/net-income?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Oracle&#x2019;s net income has stayed in the $2 billion to $3 billion range for over a decade</u></a>, <a href="https://theglobaleconomics.com/2025/12/11/oracles-ampere/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>other than a $2.7 billion spike last quarter from its sale of its shares in Ampere</u></a>.</p><p>You see, things have gotten <em>weird</em> at Oracle, in part because of the weirdness of the Ellisons themselves, and their cozy relationship with the Trump Administration (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5560216/who-is-larry-ellison-the-billionaire-trump-friend-whos-part-of-the-tiktok-takeover?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>and Trump itself</u></a>). Ellison&#x2019;s massive wealth <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537152/cbs-news-ellison-steps-appease-trump?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>backed son David Ellison&#x2019;s acquisition of Paramount</u></a>, putting conservative Bari Weiss at the helm of CBS in an attempt to placate and empower the right wing, and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Warner_Bros._Discovery?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>currently trying to buy Warner Brothers Discovery</u></a> (<a href="https://archive.is/O6CSv?ref=wheresyoured.at#selection-1264.0-1262.1"><u>though it appears Netflix may have won</u></a>), all in pursuit of kissing up to a regime steeped in brutality and bigotry that killed two people in Minnesota.</p><blockquote>As part of the media blitz, the Ellisons also took part in the acquisition of TikTok, and last week <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/heres-whats-you-should-know-about-the-us-tiktok-deal/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>established a joint venture that owns TikTok&#x2019;s US operations</u></a>, with Oracle owning 15% of the new company (along with VC Silverlake and the UAE&#x2019;s MGXs fund). Per TechCrunch:</blockquote><p>Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to a memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.</p><p>I know that you&#x2019;re likely a little scared that an ultra right-wing billionaire has bought another major social network. I know you think that Oracle, a massive and inevitable cloud storage platform owned by a man who looks like H.R. Giger drew Jerry Stiller. I know you&#x2019;re likely worried about a replay of the Elon Musk Twitter fiasco, where every week it seemed like things would collapse but it never seemed to happen, and then Musk bought an election.</p><p>What if I told you that things were very different, <em>and far more existentially perilous</em> for Oracle?</p><h1 id="oracle-is-burning-billions-of-dollars-threatening-its-future-and-larry-ellison%E2%80%99s-fortune">Oracle Is Burning Billions of Dollars, Threatening Its Future and Larry Ellison&#x2019;s Fortune</h1><p>You see, Oracle is arguably one of the single-most evil and successful companies in the world, and it&#x2019;s got there by being an aggressive vendor of database and ERP software, one that, like a tick with a law degree, cannot be removed without some degree of bloodshed. Perhaps not the highest-margin business in the world, but you know, it <em>worked.</em></p><p>Oracle has stuck to the things it&#x2019;s known for for <em>years and years</em> and done<em> just fine&#x2026;</em></p><p>&#x2026;until AI, that is. <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ORCL/oracle/gross-margin?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Let&#x2019;s see what AI has done</u></a> for Oracle&#x2019;s gross margi-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5-t8WSQafM&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OH MY GOD</u></a>!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img alt="alt" class="kg-image" height="249" src="https://www.wheresyoured.at/content/images/2026/01/data-src-image-310f9f31-0ad4-40b0-9460-34ab6269b7eb.png" width="775" /></figure><p>The scourge of AI GPUs has taken Oracle&#x2019;s gross margin from around 79% in 2021 to 68.54% in 2025, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/26/oracle-stock-on-pace-for-worst-quarter-since-2001-ai-concerns.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>with CNBC reporting that FactSet-polled analysts saw it falling to 49% by 2030</u></a>, which I think is actually being a little optimistic.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Oracle was very early to high-performance computing, becoming <a href="https://apnews.com/article/corporate-news-products-and-services-software-industry-technology-information-technology-f9439b54b82519f905c2244ba10b213c?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the first cloud in the world to have general availability of NVIDIA&#x2019;s A100 GPUs back in September 2020</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/oracle-spending-billions-nvidia-chips-this-year-ellison-2023-06-28/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>in June 2023</u></a> (at the beginning of Oracle&#x2019;s FY2024), Ellison declared that Oracle would spend &#x201c;billions&#x201d; on NVIDIA GPUs, naming AI firm Cohere as one of its customers.&#xa0;</p><p>In May 2024, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-xai-nears-10-billion-deal-to-rent-oracles-ai-servers?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Musk and Ellison discussed a massive cloud compute contract</u></a> &#x2014; a multi-year, $10 billion deal <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-xai-and-oracle-end-talks-on-a-server-deal?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>that fell apart in July 2024 when Musk got impatient</u></a>, a blow that was softened by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-to-rent-oracle-cloud-servers-for-openai?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Microsoft&#x2019;s deal to buy compute capacity for OpenAI</u></a>, for <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-xai-and-oracle-end-talks-on-a-server-deal?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>chips to be rented out of a data center in Abilene Texas</u></a> that, about six months later, OpenAI would claim was part of a &#x201c;$500 billion Stargate initiative&#x201d; announcement between Oracle, SoftBank and OpenAI that was so rushed that Ellison had to borrow a coat to stay warm on the White House lawn, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/pressure-rises-oracle-finish-openai-data-center?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>per The Information</u></a>.</p><p>&#x201c;Stargate&#x201d; is commonly misunderstood as a Trump program, or something that has raised $500 billion, when what it actually is is<em> Oracle raising debt to build data centers for OpenAI.</em> Instead of staying in its lane as a dystopian datacenter mobster, Oracle entered into negative-to-extremely-low margin realm of GPU rentals, raising $58 billion in debt and signing $248 billion in data center leases to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqe72skFe1vqpAZS-TdcjG6uDHg-6rD3MmPFM24txhb9v8QQrLksV8TlYdaz2xo%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6977e43d&amp;gaa_sig=wbdIbaaD7h6aMSZNNKRKz4XgZyjoN10ksGEwa2Q5DP30LIU2FR8zmekzNhaYy7X0ejqyw2aVU8hlDOsiQmRMfw%3D%3D&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>service a 5-year-long $300 billion contract with OpenAI that it doesn&#x2019;t have the capacity for and OpenAI doesn&#x2019;t have the money to pay for</u></a>.</p><p>Oh, and TikTok?

If it dies, there isn&#x2019;t another entity in the universe that can actually afford (or has interest in) the scale of the compute Oracle is building.</li></ul><p>We are setting up for a very funny and chaotic situation where Oracle simply <em>runs out of money, and in the process blows up Larry Ellison&#x2019;s fortune.</em> However much influence Ellison might have with the administration, Oracle has burdened itself with debt and $248 billion in data center lease obligations &#x2014; costs that are inevitable, and are already crushing the life out of the company (and the stock).&#xa0;</p><p>The only way out is if OpenAI becomes literally the most-successful cash-generating company of all time within the next two years, and that&#x2019;s being generous. This is not a joke. This is not an understatement. Sam Altman holds Larry Ellison&#x2019;s future in his clammy little hands, and there isn&#x2019;t really anything anybody can do about it other than hope for the best, because Oracle already took on all that debt and capex.</p><p>Forget about politics, forget about the fear in your heart that the darkness always wins, and join me in The Hater&#x2019;s Guide To Oracle, or <em>My Name&#x2019;s Larry Ellison, and Welcome To Jackass.</em></p>'}
