{'type': 'application/xhtml+xml', 'language': 'en-GB', 'base': 'https://xania.org/feed', 'value': '<p class="ai-disclaimer">Written by me, proof-read by an LLM.\n<br />Details at end.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s the 25th! Whatever you celebrate this time of year, I wish you the very best and hope you are having a lovely day. For me, this is a family time: I\'m not at all religious but was brought up to celebrate Christmas. So, today we\'ll be cooking a massive roast dinner and enjoying family time<sup id="fnref:teenage"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://xania.org/feed#fn:teenage">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This series was an idea I had around this time last year, and it has been a substantial amount of work. I\'ve really enjoyed writing it, and seeing the impact it has had on the compiled language community. I realise now in retrospect I exclusively used C and C++<sup id="fnref:rust"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://xania.org/feed#fn:rust">2</a></sup>, and concentrated on x86 a bit too much. If I do this again, I\'ll try and widen my horizons!</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of doing it again, I have a number of half-researched, half-written ideas that didn\'t make the cut. I may either write a few more non-advent posts exploring them, or keep them for another year. Right now I can\'t promise anything: most of the work for this series was done while I was between jobs, and now I am <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/">working full time</a> I don\'t know if I\'ll be able to do this again. Despite the low-budget look of the videos, and the shortness of the posts, it has been a pretty phenomenal amount of work. I don\'t know how regular content creators do it! I may post a follow-up on "the making of AoCO", and go into some details of how I approached this series.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to thank a number of people:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://articles.emptycrate.com">Jason Turner</a> for some ideas, feedback and for being such a proponent of Compiler Explorer over the years.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.farside.org.uk/">Malcolm Rowe</a> for his review and encouragement.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lauriewired">Laurie Kirk</a> for her help and detailed instructions on getting a decent video setup and editing workflow.</li>\n<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanski44.bsky.social">Sean Riley</a> for invaluable video editing tutoring.</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.colinhoad.com/">Colin Hoad</a> whose "Advent of Beeb" videos were the inspiration for this series.</li>\n<li>All the folks who work on compilers: GCC, clang, MSVC and the many others. I really only dug into GCC and clang, but without the hard work of compiler maintainers, this series wouldn\'t exist.</li>\n<li>All of Compiler Explorer\'s Patrons (<a href="https://patreon.com/c/mattgodbolt">join them here</a>), GitHub sponsors (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/compiler-explorer">join them here</a>), and in particular Greg Barker for his ideas.</li>\n<li>The <a href="https://github.com/orgs/compiler-explorer/people">Compiler Explorer Team</a> - a group of lovely people who very kindly give up their time to help administrate the site, triage and fix bugs, and add new features. Without them, Compiler Explorer wouldn\'t be a tenth of the site it is now.</li>\n<li>And of course, my wonderful wife, Ness, for her support over the last few months as I routinely ignored her to write articles and record and edit videos. Thank you - I love you so very much.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And of course, thank <strong>you</strong> for joining me on this journey. Compilers are amazing: truly one of the quiet modern miracles that makes the modern world possible!</p>\n\n<p><em>See <a href="https://youtu.be/N1sRfYwzmso">the video</a> that accompanies this post.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>This post is day 25 of <a href="https://xania.org/AoCO2025-archive">Advent of Compiler Optimisations 2025</a>,\na 25-day series exploring how compilers transform our code.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>← <a href="https://xania.org/202512/24-cunning-clang">When compilers surprise you</a></em></p>\n\n<p><em>This post was written by a human (<a href="https://xania.org/MattGodbolt">Matt Godbolt</a>) and reviewed and proof-read by LLMs and humans.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Support Compiler Explorer on <a href="https://patreon.com/c/mattgodbolt">Patreon</a>\nor <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/compiler-explorer">GitHub</a>,\nor by buying CE products in the <a href="https://shop.compiler-explorer.com">Compiler Explorer Shop</a></em>.</p>\n\n<div class="footnote">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:teenage">\n<p>As much as our teenage children will tolerate, anyway.\xa0<a class="footnote-backref" href="https://xania.org/feed#fnref:teenage" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id="fn:rust">\n<p>In my notes I had at least a couple of Rust ideas, but never got around to them.\xa0<a class="footnote-backref" href="https://xania.org/feed#fnref:rust" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>'}
